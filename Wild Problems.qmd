## On Narratives
::: {style="color: gray"}
1. "*Normal human beings have trouble making decisions, and when we do, we often will come up with reasons that are merely an after-the-fact narrative---something we tell ourselves and others to justify what we've done or plan to do.*"

2. "*You might respond by saying that it's wrong to"settle," to be content with someone who is merely OK rather than someone great. Actually, I'm saying something worse. I'm not encouraging you to settle; I'm telling you that you have to settle. The best spouse/partner/career/city doesn't exist and it's not just because they're hard to find. It's not a meaningful concept.*"

## On Principles

1. "*Nothing cancels out betraying who you are or who you aspire to be. So you can't add "losing respect for myself" as one of the costs of keeping the diamond.*"

2. "*So the narrow utilitarian part of the decision wasn't irrelevant. But the flourishing part of the decision was the decisive one. I took the job because I felt like it was something I was meant to do, a calling. To turn down the opportunity would have felt like a betrayal of the deepest parts of me.*"

3. "*We can imagine cases where the utilitarian costs and benefits are so large that there comes a point where sense of self is trumped. If Teodora had a child who needed an operation that she couldn't afford, I could imagine her keeping the diamond even though she would feel guilty. We would not judge her harshly. If anything, that's the exception that proves the rule---Teodora's identity as a mother would be another principle at her core competing with honesty. She would put either of those principles ahead of narrow utilitarianism.*"

## On Challenging Yourself

"*My wife went shopping at REI for gear that she needed for a five-day hiking trip she planned with her sister. The salesperson wanted to know if it was going to be a Type 1 or Type 2 experience. The difference? A Type 1 experience is nice the whole time---nothing too stressful, mostly positive. You enjoy it while you're in the middle of it and you enjoy it after. A day at the beach. A walk in the park. A Type 2 experience is hard. There are moments of pain that have to be endured---difficult days with a lot of altitude gained over a fairly short distance, streams to be crossed without your shoes where the water runs so cold your feet go numb while you're crossing, heavy gear to be carried on the trek that hurts your back or feet.*"

"*Man wants freedom to become the man he wants to become." We are in the process of becoming.*"

"*Start by facing your ignorance. Wild problems are not the kinds of problems with answers. And that's OK. It's better than OK. It's glorious, something like going to Rome for the first and only time. Sure, some of us would love for someone to give us an itinerary to go with our trip to Rome---a tour bus where all the stops are preplanned because they're the popular ones. But most of us would prefer to discover for ourselves what we love about Rome and what we might come to love. Wouldn't you rather be surprised than have it all mapped out for you? And it doesn't matter, because you can't map it out anyway.*"

"*This is the idea of Chesterton's Fence, named for an insight of G. K. Chesterton's. When you come across something that doesn't make sense to you---a fence in the middle of nowhere with no apparent purpose---you might be tempted to tear it down. Before you do, you should try to find out why it's there---it may have a cause or purpose that isn't obvious.*"

## On Putting Yourself Second

::: {style="color: gray"}
"*Getting over yourself is a good place to start---being aware that you're not the center of the universe. That requires some level of self-awareness---being aware of how your actions and words affect others and how you're perceived. Self-awareness can come from therapy, meditation, religion, or reading philosophy or literature.*"

"*Alternatively, you might choose to sublimate your own status or the ability to express yourself in hopes of making your partner shine, or to enhance the experience of all of the dancers out on the floor. You might focus on being part of something larger than yourself, weaving near and around the other dancers in unexpected and delightful ways. When you act tactfully on the dance floor and behave properly, keeping others---your partner and the other couples---in mind, you have a choice in how to think of the experience before, during, and after. You can pride yourself on your selfless behavior or you can see yourself in a more holistic way, as part of something larger than yourself, a fuller, more connected experience.*"
