    "text": "1.3 The Source of Anger\n\n\n“In our consciousness there are blocks of pain, anger, and frustration called internal formations. They are also called knots because they tie us up and obstruct our freedom. When someone insults us, or does something unkind to us, an internal formation is created in our consciousness. If you don’t know how to undo the internal knot and transform it, the knot will stay there for a long time. And the next time someone says something or does something to you of the same nature, that internal formation will grow stronger. As knots or blocks of pain in us, our internal formations have the power to push us, to dictate our behavior.”\n\n\n\n\n“Let us use a house to represent our consciousness. We can identify two parts: the basement is the store consciousness and the living area is mind consciousness. Internal formations, like anger, rest in the store consciousness—in the basement—in the form of a seed, until you hear, see, read, or think of something that touches your seed of anger. Then it comes up and manifests on the level of your mind consciousness, your living room. It manifests as a zone of energy that makes the atmosphere in your living room heavy and unpleasant. When the energy of anger comes up, we suffer.”\n\n\n\n\n“Our blocks of pain, sorrow, anger, and despair always want to come up into our mind consciousness, into our living room, because they have grown big and need our attention. They want to emerge, but we don’t want them to come up because they are painful to look at. So we try to block their way. We want them to stay asleep down in the basement. Because we do not want to face them, our habit is to fill our living room with other guests. But whenever we have ten or fifteen minutes of free time, and we don’t know what to do, these internal knots will come up and make a mess in the living room. To avoid this, we pick up a book, we turn on the television, we go for a drive, we do anything to keep our living room occupied. When the living room is occupied, these unpleasant internal formations will not come up.”",

Self-love is the foundation for your capacity to love the other person. If you don’t take good care of yourself, if you are not happy, if you are not peaceful, you cannot make the other person happy. You cannot help the other person; you cannot love. Your capacity for loving another person depends entirely on your capacity for loving yourself, for taking care of yourself.”\n\n\n\n\n“Your intelligence, your knowledge, does not help you change your habit energy. Only the practice of recognizing, embracing, and transforming can help. That is why the Buddha advised us to practice mindful breathing to recognize and take care of our habit energy as soon as it manifests. If you are capable of embracing your habit energy with the energy of mindfulness, then you are safe, you are not going to make the same mistake again.”\n\n\n\n\n“When our child is drowning in a strong emotion, we can hold his or her hand and say,”My dear one, breathe. Breathe in and out with Mommy, with Daddy.” We can also invite our child to do walking meditation with us, gently taking her hand and helping her calm down, with each step. When you give your child some of your mindfulness energy, she will be able to calm down very quickly and embrace her emotions.”",

    "text": "1.6 Transforming Anger\n\n\n“Anger is in us in the form of a seed. The seeds of love and compassion are also there. In our consciousness, there are many negative seeds and also many positive seeds. The practice is to avoid watering the negative seeds, and to identify and water the positive seeds every day. This is the practice of love.”\n\n\n\n\n“When we’re angry with someone, we want to hurt them. Giving them a present changes that into wanting to make them happy. So, when you are angry with someone, send him a present. After you have sent it, you will stop being angry with him. It’s very simple, and it always works.”\n\n\n\n\n“There are moments when we feel very grateful for the other person in our life. We deeply appreciate his or her presence. We are full of compassion, gratitude, and love. We have experienced moments like this in our life. We feel so grateful that the other person is still alive, that she is still with us, and has stood by our side during very difficult times. I would suggest that if such a moment happens again, take advantage of it. To truly profit from this time, withdraw to a place where you can be alone with yourself. Don’t just go to the other person and say,”I’m grateful you are there.” That is not enough. You can do this later. Right at that moment, it is better to withdraw into your room or to a quiet place, and immerse yourself in that feeling of gratitude. Then write down your feelings, your gratitude, your happiness. In half a page or one page, do your best to express yourself in writing, or record yourself on tape.”\n\n\n\n\n“If you can remind yourself that the positive elements are still present within you and the other person, you will know that it is possible to break through, so that the best things in both of you can come up and manifest again.”",

With every step, you can arrive in the present moment, you can step into the Pure Land or into the Kingdom of God. When you are walking from one side of the room to the other, or from one building to another, be aware of the contact of your feet with the earth and be aware of the contact of the air as it enters your body. It may help you to discover how many steps you can make comfortably during an in-breath and how many during an out-breath. As you breathe in, you can say”in,” and as you breathe out, you can say ”out.”\n\n\n\n\n“To learn how to live each moment of our daily life in deep mindfulness and concentration is the practice.”\n\n\n\n\n“You have to be aware that your emotion is just an emotion. It comes, stays for some time, and then goes away.”\n\n\n\n\n“Let us bring our attention down to our belly and breathe in and out. This storm will go away, so don’t be afraid.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you remove the embargo and the blocks of pain come up, you will have to suffer a bit. There is no way to avoid it. And that is why the Buddha said that you have to learn how to embrace this pain. It is for this reason that the practice of mindfulness is so important. You generate a strong source of energy so that you can recognize, embrace, and take care of these negative energies.”\n\n\n\n\n“If you see elements of garbage in you, like fear, despair, and hatred, don’t panic. As a good organic gardener, a good practitioner, you can face this:”I recognize that there is garbage in me. I am going to transform this garbage into nourishing compost that can make love reappear.”",

Recognize first that the main cause of your suffering is the seed of anger in you, and that the other person is only a secondary cause.”\n\n\n\n\n“Human beings are not our enemy. Our enemy is not the other person. Our enemy is the violence, ignorance, and injustice in us and in the other person. When we are armed with compassion and understanding, we fight not against other people, but against the tendency to invade, to dominate, and to exploit.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you judge and take sides, you act as though you are outside of the conflict. You act as though you are not the black driver who was beaten, or the four policemen. But looking deeply, you see that you are the victim of the beating, and you are also the four policemen who did the beating.”\n\n\n\n\n“Stopping violence is what we have to do. And we cannot stop violence unless we have the insight that what we do to the other person, we are doing to ourselves.”\n\n\n\n\n“The way to share your insight is to help create the conditions so that others can realize the same insight—through their own experience, not just believing what you say.

Whatever your children do continues to affect you deeply—just like when they were in your womb. Whatever you do still affects your children deeply because they can never be cut off from you. Your happiness and suffering are your child’s happiness and suffering and vice versa. That is why you have to invest one hundred percent of yourself in the task of restoring communication.”\n\n\n\n\n“Most of our suffering is born from our lack of understanding and insight that there is no separate self. The other person is you, you are the other person. If you get in touch with that truth, anger will vanish.”\n\n\n\n\n“Who do you think you are? You are the other person. If you get angry with your son, you are getting angry with yourself. You are wrong to think that your son is not you. Your son is you. Genetically, physiologically, scientifically, your son is your continuation. That is the real truth.”\n\n\n\n\n“So to help your son, make peace with yourself. Look deeply into yourself. If you want to help your mother, restore peace in yourself. Discover the insight that will allow you to help your mother. Helping yourself is the first condition for helping the other. Let go of the illusion called self. This is the essence of the practice that will free you and the other person from anger and suffering.”",

If this statement means anything, it must be that they could have behaved differently—not on the basis of random influences over which they have no control, but because they, as conscious agents, were free to think and act in other ways. To say that they were free not to rape and murder is to say that they could have resisted the impulse to do so (or could have avoided feeling such an impulse altogether)—with the universe, including their brains, in precisely the same state it was in at the moment they committed their crimes. Assuming that violent criminals have such freedom, we reflexively blame them for their actions. But without it, the place for our blame suddenly vanishes, and even the most terrifying sociopaths begin to seem like victims themselves.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Sam. 2012. Free Will.

He will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will—to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable.”\n\n\n\n\n“The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student, polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to”refusing” to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a ”denial” of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized.”\n\n\n\n\n“But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man’s mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and enjoys but little—he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense suffering.”",

Among the many reasons, is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a man may be both Free and yet bound by Necessity, depending upon the meaning of the terms, and the height of Truth from which the matter is examined. The ancient writers express the matter thus:”The further the creation is from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches, the nearer Free is it.”\n\n\n\n\n“The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity, environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying,”Why, I certainly am free to act and do as I please—I do just what I want to do,” but they fail to explain whence arise the ”want to” and ”as I please.” What makes them ”want to” do one thing in preference to another; what makes them ”please” to do this, and not do that? Is there no ”because” to their ”pleasing” and ”Wanting”? The Master can change these ”pleases” and ”wants” into others at the opposite end of the mental pole. He is able to ”Will to will,” instead of to will because some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a tendency or desire within him so to do.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiates, Three. 1908.

It is that when one is deceived or commits an injustice, one suffers no pain in one’s head, or eyes, or one’s hip, nor does one lose any land; and we’re concerned about nothing other than things of that kind. As to whether our choice is kept honest and trustworthy, or be shameful and unreliable, that doesn’t cause us the slightest concern, except when it comes to making fine speeches in the classroom.

Noninterference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child’s task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.”\n\n\n\n\n“When reward is at the base of an interpersonal relationship, there’s a feeling that wells up in one that says, ”I gave this much, so you should give me that much back.” This is a notion that is quite different from separation of tasks, of course. We must not seek reward, and we must not be tied to it.”\n\n\n\n\n“You convey words of gratitude, saying thank you to this partner who has helped you with your work. You might express straightforward delight: ”I’m glad.” Or you could convey your thanks by saying, ”That was a big help.” This is an approach to encouragement that is based on horizontal relationships.”\n\n\n\n\n“Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgment from another person as ”good.” And the measure of what is good or bad about that act is that person’s yardstick. If receiving praise is what one is after, one will have no choice but to adapt to that person’s yardstick and put the brakes on one’s own freedom. ”Thank you,” on the other hand, rather than being judgment, is a clear expression of gratitude. When one hears words of gratitude, one knows that one has made a contribution to another person.”\n\n\n\n\n“They treat the idealized image as one hundred points, and they gradually subtract from that. This is truly a ”judgment” way of thinking. Instead, the parents could refrain from comparing their child to anyone else, see him for who he actually is, and be glad and grateful for his being there.”\n\n\n\n\n“We can live only in the here and now. Our lives exist only in moments. Adults who do not know this attempt to impose ”linear” lives onto young people.

This simple act can set a course to start each day still, centered, and in the moment.”\n\n\n\n\n“Nature transcends our tendencies to label and classify, to reduce and limit. The natural world is unfathomably more rich, interwoven, and complicated than we are taught, and so much more mysterious and beautiful.”\n\n\n\n\n“An old man in Calcutta would walk to get water from a well every day. He’d carry a clay pot and lower it by hand slowly, all the way down, careful not to let it hit the sides of the well and break. Once it was full, he’d raise the pot slowly and carefully again. It was a focused, time-consuming act. One day, a traveler noticed the old man engaged in this difficult task. More experienced with mechanics, he showed the old man how to use a pulley system. ”This will allow the pot to go straight down quickly,” the traveler explained, ”then fill with water and come back up, without hitting the sides. It’s much easier and the pot will be just as full with much less work.” The old man looked at him and said, ”I think I’m going to keep doing it the way I always have. I really have to think about each movement and there’s a great deal of care that goes into doing it right. I’d imagine if I were to use the pulley, it would become easy and I might even start thinking about something else while doing it. If I put so little care and time into it, what might the water taste like? It couldn’t possibly taste as good.””\n\n\n\n\n“Formulating an opinion is not listening. Neither is preparing a response, or defending our position or attacking another’s. To listen impatiently is to hear nothing at all. Listening is suspending disbelief.”\n\n\n\n\n“Many of our beliefs were learned before we had a choice in what we were taught. Some of them might go back generations and may no longer apply. Some may never have applied. Listening, then, is not just awareness. It’s freedom from accepted limitations.”\n\n\n\n\n“Be aware of strong responses. If you’re immediately turned off by an experience, it’s worth examining why.”\n\n\n\n\n“Working to free yourself from inner voices is a kind of meditation. Set aside all concerns for a stretch of time and say, I’m only going to focus on this one practice: making great work.”\n\n\n\n\n“In addition to meditation, we might softly hold on to a question and go for a walk, swim, or drive. The question isn’t being worked on, just loosely held in awareness. We are posing it gently to the Universe and opening ourselves to receive an answer.”",

A more skillful goal might be to find comfort in the process. To make and put out successive works with ease.”\n\n\n\n\n“We can apply this same technique to ourselves and embrace our imperfections.

And they are more likely to undermine the work.”\n\n\n\n\n“For every rule followed, examine the possibility that the opposite might be similarly interesting. Not necessarily better, just different. In the same way, you can try the opposite or the extreme of what’s suggested in these pages and it will likely be just as fruitful.”\n\n\n\n\n“If we live in a mindset of scarcity, we hoard great ideas. A comedian may be presented with a perfect opportunity to tell a favorite new joke they’ve written, but instead will hold it back waiting for a more high-profile occasion. When we use our material, new content comes through. And the more we share, the more our skills improve.”\n\n\n\n\n“In the process of experimentation, we allow ourselves to make mistakes, to go too far, to go even further, to be inept. There is no failure, as every step we take is necessary to reach our destination, including the missteps. Each experiment is valuable in its own way if we learn something from it.

Source: chatgpt.\nThe following quotes are from Housel (2020).\n\n\n“Studying history makes you feel like you understand something. But until you’ve lived through it and personally felt its consequences, you may not understand it enough to change your behavior.”\n\n\n\n\n“”You had a bad outcome so it must have been caused by a bad decision” is the story that makes the most sense to me. But when judging myself I can make up a wild narrative justifying my past decisions and attributing bad outcomes to risk.”\n\n\n\n\n“But the majority of Benjamin Graham’s investing success was due to owning an enormous chunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke nearly every diversification rule that Graham himself laid out in his famous texts.”\n\n\n\n\n“Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”\n\n\n\n\n“Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but ”poverty will not make you feel the pain.”\n\n\n\n\n“There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.”\n\n\n\n\n“But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”31”\n\n\n\n\n“But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.”\n\n\n\n\n“Savings can be created by spending less. You can spend less if you desire less. And you will desire less if you care less about what others think of you.”\n\n\n\n\n“It had been built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining much worse—and not thinking that the worst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent.”\n\n\n\n\n“The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next.”\n\n\n\n\n“Many investors and economists take comfort in knowing their forecasts are backed up by decades, even centuries, of data. But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future.”\n\n\n\n\n“The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—”unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day.”\n\n\n\n\n“So if many things rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you are counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of failure.”\n\n\n\n\n“An underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves.”\n\n\n\n\n“Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd.”\n\n\n\n\n“But if you view volatility as a fee, things look different.”\n\n\n\n\n“But while we can see how much money other people spend on cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don’t get to see their goals, worries, and aspirations. A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations, I’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment because I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s getting. We might not even have different styles. We’re just playing a different game. It took me years to figure this out.”\n\n\n\n\n“Another is that pessimists often extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt.”\n\n\n\n\n“A doctor may throw the kitchen sink at her patient’s cancer, but choose palliative care for herself.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousel, Morgan. 2020.

    "text": "Musonius Rufus (c. 30-100 AD) was a Roman Stoic philosopher. He was known for his teachings on ethics, virtue, and the principles of Stoicism. Musonius Rufus was a prominent figure in the Stoic school and had a significant influence on his contemporaries and later Stoic philosophers. Source: chatgpt.\nThe following quotes are from King (2011).\n\n\n“And yet, wouldn’t everyone agree that it is much better to work to gain control over one’s own desires than it is to work to gain possession of someone else’s wife—and for a person to train himself to want little instead of struggling to become wealthy? And instead of exerting effort to gain fame, shouldn’t a person strive to overcome his thirst for it? Instead of searching for a way to damage a person whom he envies, shouldn’t he contemplate how not to bear envy against anyone? Instead of being slavish to some so-called friends, who are actually insincere, shouldn’t he make sacrifices to win true friends?”\n\n\n\n\n“you are a good and virtuous person, exile would not harm or diminish you, because you still have the things that can best assist and elevate you.”\n\n\n\n\n“A beast is not able to comprehend that many of the wrongs done to people are done out of ignorance and a lack of understanding. A person who gains this comprehension immediately stops doing wrong.”\n\n\n\n\n“And, indeed, at each meal, there is not one chance for making a mistake, but several. The person who eats more than he should makes a mistake. So does the person who eats in a hurry, the person who is enthralled by gourmet food, the person who favors sweets over nutritious foods, and the person who does not share his food equally with his fellow-diners. We make another mistake in connection with food when we leave what we are supposed to be doing in order to eat, even though it isn’t mealtime.”\n\n\n\n\n“is not possible to live well today unless you treat it as your last day.”\n\n\n\n\n“The treasures of Croesus and Cinyras we shall consider equivalent to extreme poverty. Indeed, we will hold that one man and one man only is truly wealthy—he who learns to want nothing in every circumstance.”\n\n\n\n\n“”Consider this. If you have accomplished something good through hard work, that labor will quickly disappear. If something is done well by you, it will not disappear as long as you live. But if you have done something wicked in the pursuit of pleasure, the pleasure will quickly disappear, but the wicked thing will stay with you forever.””\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing, Cinthia. 2011.

And it gets worse: the more accomplished one is at the peak of one’s career, the more pronounced decline seems once it has set in.”\n\n\n\n\n“The researchers found that physicians over sixty-five are 50 percent more likely than younger doctors (under fifty-one) at being found at fault for malpractice.”\n\n\n\n\n“We might call this the “principle of psychoprofessional gravitation”: the idea that the agony of decline is directly related to prestige previously achieved, and to one’s emotional attachment to that prestige.”\n\n\n\n\n“The first is fluid intelligence, which Cattell defined as the ability to reason, think flexibly, and solve novel problems. Fluid intelligence isn’t the only kind—there is also crystallized intelligence.

Success, the fruit of excellence, becomes an addiction. All because of pride. In fact, perfectionism and the fear of failure go hand in hand: they lead you to believe that success isn’t about doing something good but about not doing something bad.”\n\n\n\n\n“The point is that the symbols of your specialness have encrusted you like a ton of barnacles. Not only are these things incapable of bringing you any real satisfaction; they’re making you too heavy to jump to your next curve.”\n\n\n\n\n“In the East, we believe the art already exists, and our job is simply to reveal it. It is not visible because we add something, but because we take away the parts that are not the art.”\n\n\n\n\n“I shall overcome with the simplicity of original nature. With the simplicity of true nature, there shall be no desire. Without desire, one’s original nature will be at peace.

Elite credentials don’t make you relatable. They are a barrier to deep human connection.”\n\n\n\n\n“sadness has persisted in the face of evolution because it brings cognitive benefits. There is evidence that it makes us better at assessing reality in social situations, because we are less likely to flatter ourselves or gloss over negative truths. Sadness can even make us more productive at work by enhancing focus and helping us learn from mistakes. This is how failure, via the resulting negative emotions, can help lead to later success.”\n\n\n\n\n“Research shows that stress inoculation training—in which people learn to cope with anger, fear, and anxiety by being exposed to stimuli that cause these feelings—is effective in creating emotional resilience. It is easy to imagine that attempts to eliminate pain and weakness from daily life could lead to a sort of emotional allergy—that when hard times come and someone feels grief or fear that is impossible to ignore, that person will not have the tools to face these feelings.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooks, Arthur C. 2022.

But it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order. When you do things in the right way, at the right time, everything else will be organized.”\n\n\n\n\n“Written teaching is a kind of food for your brain. Of course it is necessary to take some food for your brain, but it is more important to be yourself by practicing the right way of life.”\n\n\n\n\n“Our usual understanding of life is dualistic: you and I, this and that, good and bad. But actually these discriminations are themselves the awareness of the universal existence. “You” means to be aware of the universe in the form of you, and “I” means to be aware of it in the form of I. You and I are just swinging doors.”\n\n\n\n\n“All that we should do is just do something as it comes. Do something! Whatever it is, we should do it, even if it is not-doing something. We should live in this moment.”\n\n\n\n\n“If something comes into your mind, let it come in, and let it go out. It will not stay long.”\n\n\n\n\n“Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind. If you leave your mind as it is, it will become calm. This mind is called big mind.”\n\n\n\n\n“One who thinks he is a good father is not a good father; one who thinks he is a good husband is not a good husband. One who thinks he is one of the worst husbands may be a good one if he is always trying to be a good husband with a single-hearted effort.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you are sitting in the middle of your own problem, which is more real to you: your problem or you yourself? The awareness that you are here, right now, is the ultimate fact. This is the point you will realize by zazen practice.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you give up, when you no longer want something, or when you do not try to do anything special, then you do something. When there is no gaining idea in what you do, then you do something.”\n\n\n\n\n“But if your mind is calm and constant, you can keep yourself away from the noisy world even though you are in the midst of it. In the midst of noise and change, your mind will be quiet and stable.”\n\n\n\n\n“So try not to see something in particular; try not to achieve anything special. You already have everything in your own pure quality. If you understand this ultimate fact, there is no fear.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you are idealistic, you have some gaining idea within yourself; by the time you attain your ideal or goal, your gaining idea will create another ideal.”\n\n\n\n\n“Most people live in delusion, involved in their problem, trying to solve their problem. But just to live is actually to live in problems. And to solve the problem is to be a part of it, to be one with it.”\n\n\n\n\n“Our understanding of Buddhism should not be just gathering many pieces of information, seeking to gain knowledge. Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.”\n\n\n\n\n“You have difficulty because you have feeling. You attach to the feeling you have without knowing just how this kind of feeling is created. When you do not realize that you are one with the river, or one with the universe, you have fear.”\n\n\n\n\n“This teaching is also understood as the teaching of selflessness. Because each existence is in constant change, there is no abiding self. In fact, the self-nature of each existence is nothing but change itself, the self-nature of all existence.”\n\n\n\n\n“But as long as you have some fixed idea or are caught by some habitual way of doing things, you cannot appreciate things in their true sense.”\n\n\n\n\n“Now it is raining, but we don’t know what will happen in the next moment. By the time we go out it may be a beautiful day, or a stormy day. Since we don’t know, let’s appreciate the sound of the rain now.”\n\n\n\n\n“A flower falls, even though we love it; and a weed grows, even though we do not love it. Even though it is so, this is our life.”\n\n\n\n\n“Happiness is sorrow; sorrow is happiness. There is happiness in difficulty; difficulty in happiness. Even though the ways we feel are different, they are not really different; in essence they are the same.”\n\n\n\n\n“Before something happens in the realm of calmness, we do not feel the calmness; only when something happens within it do we find the calmness.”\n\n\n\n\n“to make a million dollars, or to enjoy your life in your effort, little by little, even though it is impossible to make that million; to be successful, or to find some meaning in your effort to be successful? If you do not know the answer, you will not even be able to practice zazen; if you do know, you will have found the true treasure of life.”\n\n\n\n\n“Actually, good and bad is not the point. Whether or not you make yourself peaceful is the point, and whether or not you stick to it.”\n\n\n\n\n“We must have beginner’s mind, free from possessing anything, a mind that knows everything is in flowing change.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzuki, Shinryu. 1970.

    "text": "16.1 Quotes\nThe neuroscientist Professor Sarah Gimbel watched what happened when people in brain scanners were presented with evidence their strongly held political beliefs were wrong. ‘The response in the brain that we see is very similar to what would happen if, say, you were walking through the forest and came across a bear,’ she has said. Researchers have found that violence and cruelty has four general causes: greed and ambition; sadism; high self-esteem and moral idealism. Popular belief and clichéd stories tend to have it that greed and sadism are dominant. In fact, they’re vanishingly small. It’s actually high self-esteem and moral idealism – convictions of personal and moral superiority – that drive most acts of evil. ‘You talk about the people as if you owned them, as though they belonged to you,’ he says, slurring slightly. ‘Goodness. As long as I can remember you’ve talked about giving the people their rights, as if you could make them a present of liberty. As a reward for services rendered. Remember the working man? You used to write an awful lot about the working man. But he’s turning to something called organised labour. You’re not going to like that one little bit when you find out it means that your working man expects something as his right, not as your gift. When your precious underprivileged really get together The terrible and fascinating truth about the human condition is that none of us really know the answer to the dramatic question as it pertains to ourselves. We don’t know why we do what we do, or feel what we feel. We confabulate when theorising as to why we’re depressed, we confabulate when justifying our moral convictions and we confabulate when explaining why a piece of music moves us. Our sense of self is organised by an unreliable narrator. We’re led to believe we’re in complete control of ourselves, but we’re not. We’re led to believe we really know who we are, but we don’t. Michael Gazzaniga individuals are essentially scientists erecting and testing their hypotheses about the world and revising them in the light of their experience. We believe we’re in control of ourselves but we’re continually being altered by the world and people around us. The difference is that in life, unlike in story, the dramatic question of who we are never has a final and truly satisfying answer. When people in brain scanners read of another’s wealth, popularity, good looks and qualifications, regions involved in the perception of pain became activated. When they read about them suffering a misfortune, they enjoyed a pleasurable spike in their brain’s reward systems. All of us are being silently controlled by any number of instructional stories at once. Tribal stories blind us. They allow us to see only half the truth, at best. Keeping the secret of ourselves from ourselves can be exhausting. This, perhaps, is the subversive truth of stories about antiheroes. Being freed to be evil, if only in our minds, can be such a joyful relief. Because humans crave control, infants whose caregivers behave unpredictably can grow up in a constant state of anxious high alert. Their distress gets built into their core concepts about people which can lead to significant social problems when they’re grown. The psychologists Professors John Bransford and Marcia Johnson asked people to remember the following passage: ‘We are our personal projects.’ “Stop hoping for happiness tomorrow. Happiness is being engaged in the process.”’ ‘The transformation that narrative transportation achieves is persuasion of the story-receiver.’ The magic of story is its ability to connect mind with mind in a manner that’s unrivalled even by love. Story’s gift is the hope that we might not be quite so alone, in that dark bone vault, after all.",

    "text": "“In a stable environment, the brain is relatively calm. But when it detects change, that event is immediately registered as a surge of neural activity.”\n\n\n\n\n“Control is why brains are on constant alert for the unexpected. Unexpected change is a portal through which danger arrives to swipe at our throats.”\n\n\n\n\n“There’s no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.”\n\n\n\n\n“‘There is a natural inclination to resolve information gaps,’ wrote Loewenstein, ‘even for questions of no importance.’ There is, concluded Loewenstein, a ‘positive relationship between curiosity and knowledge’. The more context we learn about a mystery, the more anxious we become to solve it.”\n\n\n\n\n“four ways of involuntarily inducing curiosity in humans: (1) the ‘posing of a question or presentation of a puzzle’; (2) ‘exposure to a sequence of events with an anticipated but unknown resolution’; (3) ‘the violation of expectations that triggers a search for an explanation’; (4) knowledge of ‘possession of information by someone else’.”\n\n\n\n\n“‘Evolution shaped us with perceptions that allow us to survive,’ the cognitive scientist Professor Donald Hoffman has said. ‘But part of that involves hiding from us the stuff we don’t need to know. And that’s pretty much all of reality, whatever reality might be.’”\n\n\n\n\n“Brains take information from the outside world – in whatever form they can – and turn it into models.”\n\n\n\n\n“When designing a character, it’s often useful to think of them in terms of their theory of control. How have they learned to control the world?”\n\n\n\n\n“For Westerners, reality is made up of individual pieces and parts. When threatening unexpected change strikes, we tend to reimpose control by going to war with those pieces and parts and trying to tame them. For Easterners, reality is a field of interconnected forces. When threatening unexpected change strikes, they’re more likely to reimpose control by attempting to understand how to bring those turbulent forces back into harmony so that they can all exist together. What they have in common is story’s deepest purpose. They are lessons in control.”\n\n\n\n\n“Once [the brain’s] internal structures are established they turn the relationship between the internal and external around. Instead of the internal structures being shaped by the environment, the individual now acts to preserve established structures in the face of environmental challenges, and finds changes in structure difficult and painful.”\n\n\n\n\n“The rational response, when encountering someone with alien ideas, would be to either attempt to understand them or shrug. And yet we become distressed. Our threatened neural models generate waves of sometimes overwhelming negative feelings. Incredibly, the brain treats threats to our neural models in the much same way as it defends our bodies from a physical attack, putting us into a tense and stressful fight-or-flight state. The person with merely differing views becomes a dangerous antagonist, a force that’s actively attempting to harm us.”\n\n\n\n\n“It’s not simply that we ignore or forget evidence that goes against what our models tell us (although we do that too). We find dubious ways of rejecting the authority of opposing experts, give arbitrary weight to some parts of their testimony and not others, lock onto the tiniest genuine flaws in their argument and use them to dismiss them entirely. Intelligence isn’t effective at dissolving these cognitive mirages of rightness. Smart people are mostly better at finding ways to ‘prove’ they’re right and tend to be no better at detecting their wrongness.”\n\n\n\n\n“My mental life is simply given to me by the cosmos. Why didn’t I decide to drink a glass of juice? The thought never occurred to me. Am I free to do that which does not occur to me to do? Of course not.”\n\n\n\n\n“My mental life is simply given to me by the cosmos. Why didn’t I decide to drink a glass of juice? The thought never occurred to me.

    "text": "“The Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano had attempted to quantify the maths of dice gambling in the sixteenth century. What, for instance, would the odds be of rolling a six on four rolls of a die, or a double six on twenty-four rolls of a pair of dice?”\n\n\n\n\n“Note that there are three moving parts and adjusting any one of them means changing at least one of the others. So if you’ve drawn a sample that’s large enough for you to be 90 percent sure that it’s within 10 percent of the true answer, but you want to be 99 percent sure, you either have to adjust your spread—make it wider than 10 percent—or you have to take a larger sample.”\n\n\n\n\n“Bernoulli thought that we could talk about certainty as a number: 1 for complete certainty, 0 for complete impossibility. And that meant that you could have degrees of certainty, and improve that certainty by experiment.”\n\n\n\n\n“He showed that the accuracy of your estimate grew in proportion to the square root of the sample size.”\n\n\n\n\n“probability is an expression of our lack of knowledge about the world.”\n\n\n\nHume, in his 1748 essay “Of Miracles,” argued that no amount of testimony should ever convince someone that a miracle, a violation of natural law, took place: he never actually said “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” but that’s the gist of it. “[No] testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle,” wrote Hume, “unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish.” If someone were to say that he had seen the dead restored to life, Hume continues, “I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened.”\n\n\n\n“Where Bayes’ theorem takes you from data to hypothesis—How likely is the hypothesis to be true, given the data I’ve seen?—frequentist statistics take you from hypothesis to data: How likely am I to see this data, assuming a given hypothesis is true?”\n\n\n\n\n“Specifically, it was about the maximum likelihood method. “Likelihood,” in Fisher’s new jargon, was essentially a way of saying how likely one particular hypothesis was, given some data, compared to another. For example, imagine you flip eight heads on ten coins. That’s pretty unlikely on a fair coin: it would only happen about one time in twenty. But if you had a dodgy coin somehow, one that came up heads 80 percent of the time, then you’d expect to see exactly eight heads about one time in three. You’re about seven times as likely to see this data under the hypothesis “this coin is biased and comes up heads eight times out of ten” than under the hypothesis “this coin is fair.” So the likelihood ratio between these two hypotheses is about seven.”\n\n\n\n\n“Bayesianism treats probability as subjective: a statement about our ignorance of the world. Frequentists treat it as objective: a statement about how often some outcome will happen, if you do it a huge number of times.”\n\n\n\n\n“If we assume a uniform prior—that is, that any length is equally likely—then we should also say that a 1 cm × 1 cm square is just as likely as a 9 cm × 9 cm square. But on the other hand, surely we should also say we’re uniformly ignorant of the area of the box. The largest area it could have is 100 square centimeters (10 cm × 10 cm). If we’re assuming uniform ignorance, then a piece of paper less than 50 square centimeters in area should be just as likely as a piece of paper more than 50 square centimeters in area. The trouble is that those two claims can’t both be true. If we’re uniformly ignorant of the length of the sides, then it’s more than 70 percent likely that the square will have an area less than 50 square centimeters. (A 7 cm × 7 cm square would have an area of 49 square centimeters, because 7 × 7 = 49.) Meanwhile, if we’re uniformly ignorant of the area, then it’s 75 per cent likely that the sides will be at least 5 cm long (5 × 5 = 25). Again, as with Boole’s criticism, there are different kinds of ignorance, and we are ignorant of which one to use.”\n\n\n\n\n“The problems in science were many and varied, but a major one was that scientists weren’t asking how likely their hypothesis was to be true, given the data they had collected—they were asking (as Bernoulli had, and Fisher) how likely it was that they would see the data they had collected, if the hypothesis was false.”\n\n\n\n\n“Many experimentalists, when asked what 5% significance means, often say that the probability of the null hypothesis is 0.05. But, of course, that’s not what it means: it’s just how likely you would be to see data at least that extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.”\n\n\n\n\n“The easiest way to get a p &lt; 0.05 result—that is, something that you’d only see by coincidence one time in twenty—is to do twenty experiments, and then publish the one that comes up. That’s exactly what the “False Positive Psychology” people did: they measured lots and lots of things, when they were looking at their undergraduates. Their parents’ birthdays, how old they felt, their political orientation, whether they referred to the past as “the good old days,” a whole bunch of things. They also gave them another song to listen to: “Hot Potato” by the Wiggles.”\n\n\n\n\n“This is a problem for science in its own right. Imagine one hundred labs carry out studies into whether or not psychic powers are real, and ninety-five of them find nothing, but five of them find statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.05! You’d only see results like that five times out of every one hundred if it wasn’t real!). But because journals want to publish interesting, novel things, they might very well publish all five of the “psychic powers are real” papers and only one of the “psychic powers aren’t real” papers, meaning that if someone went to the scientific literature, they’d find that 85 percent of studies looking into psychic powers find them. If you speak to many scientists, you’ll hear a lot of stories of them getting rejections because their results weren’t “novel” enough, which, of course, means that the scientific literature systematically fills up with “novel,” exciting studies that do find things, while the boring, not novel, but often more actually true findings are rejected.”\n\n\n\n\n“But you could go deeper and say that the underlying cause of the replication crisis is even more basic: it’s that science, like Jakob Bernoulli three hundred years ago, is doing sampling probabilities, not inferential probabilities.”\n\n\n\n\n“A p-value is not, as we’ve discussed, a measure of how likely it is that your hypothesis is true, given your data. It’s a measure of how likely it is that you would see that data, given a certain hypothesis. But—as Bayes noted, and as Laplace later fleshed out—that’s not enough. If you want to measure how likely it is that your hypothesis is true, you simply cannot avoid priors. You need Bayes’ theorem. The question, of course, is whether that is what you want.”\n\n\n\n\n“What p-values tell you is how likely you are to see that data, given a hypothesis.”\n\n\n\n\n“you should take prior probabilities into account. If you have some hypothesis, like ‘the moon is made of cheese,’ you’d have very low priors, so new data doesn’t move the needle much. It might give you a hint of being convinced, but it doesn’t drown out your prior skepticism.”\n\n\n\n\n“All swans are white. Imagine that you see a white swan. Does that prove that all swans are white? No, of course not. We could see another white swan; it still won’t prove it. There is no number of white swans that you could see before you could say with certainty that all swans are white. That’s simple Aristotelian logic. You can’t infer a universal law from individual examples: the syllogism “This is a swan, this swan is white, ergo all swans are white” is not a valid one.”\n\n\n\n\n“We don’t want to know how surprising the data is if the null hypothesis is true; we want to know the plausibility of the null hypothesis, now that we’ve seen the data. Ultimately, fundamentally, that’s the question.”\n\n\n\n\n“Aleatory uncertainty is the uncertainty in an unknowable future—aleatory coming from the Latin word alea meaning “a die.” (“ Iacta alea est,” as Caesar said, according to Suetonius, as he crossed the Rubicon and marched on Rome—“ The die is cast,” meaning that the consequences of his decision were coming, whatever they were, and they were unknowable.”\n\n\n\n\n“But then there’s epistemic uncertainty, from epistēmē, the Greek word meaning “knowledge.” That’s what Cassie Kozyrkov was demonstrating above. If you flip a coin, then you catch it, but don’t look at it—then there’s no aleatory uncertainty. The result is there, it’s happened, that’s it. Still, though. You don’t have any new information. As far as you’re concerned, the question is no closer to being resolved than it was before.”\n\n\n\n\n“Some academics I know advocate something called Registered Reports, in which journals agree to publish papers on the strength of their methods, before the data is collected, so then, whether the researchers find exciting, headline-worthy results or boring, null results, those results will go on to become part of the scientific record. Several relatively major journals have signed up for Registered Reports, and I think they’re a good idea—they remove the incentive to slice the data until you get a positive result, and they remove the problem of publication bias.”\n\n\n\n\n“So let’s say that when it rains, you see wet pavements 80 percent of the time. When it doesn’t rain, you still sometimes see wet pavements—say, your sprinklers come on 20 percent of the time. You’re four times more likely to see wet pavements under the hypothesis it has rained than under the hypothesis it has not rained. That’s your likelihood ratio, and that tells you how much to update your beliefs—how much more plausible the “rain” hypothesis is, given the “wet pavements” evidence.”\n\n\n\n\n“he has given his name to an important rule of Bayesian decision theory, Cromwell’s rule. Named by Dennis Lindley, the rule says that you should never assign anything, other than a logically necessary truth such as “2 + 2 = 4,” a probability of one or zero. That is: you should never be certain. ”\n\n\n\n\n“I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible—if not necessarily likely—that you may be mistaken.”\n\n\n\n\n“If you see a puppy-torture video, as you expected, then that would shift your beliefs somewhat—up from p = 0.9 to p ≈ 0.99. But, because it’s expected, it doesn’t shift your views all that much. But if you don’t see the video—if you are surprised—then it must move your beliefs a long way. In this case, your strong expectation being confounded would lead to your belief in the politician being a dog-torturer crashing to just p ≈ 0.33, one in three.”\n\n\n\n\n“If, for instance, you strongly expected to see the video, and then didn’t, and shrugged your shoulders and said, “Well, she’s probably bad anyway,” then you’re going to make yourself more wrong than you need to be.”\n\n\n\n\n“What minimum message length asks is: What is the shortest computer program I could write that would describe a given output?”\n\n\n\n\n“That’s how much you should trade off between complexity and good fit. If an extra bit of information in your program doesn’t allow you to halve the search space, then it’s not paying its way. It’s not compressing the data—you’re just shifting it into the program, rather than the data.”\n\n\n\n\n“That’s a hyperprior—a higher-level prediction about the shape of the world, one that constrains and informs lower-level ones. Just as with the normal prior, you assign probabilities to how likely it is you’re in one world or another.”\n\n\n\n\n“So your urge to be right can drive you in two different directions: to force your views on other people, or to throw away ideas that are causing you to be wrong.”\n\n\n\n\n“You have a large heap of sand. You remove one grain of sand. It’s clearly still a heap. You remove another grain of sand. It’s clearly still a heap. You keep removing grains, one after the other, until there is just one grain left. Now it’s clearly not a heap. At what point did it stop? Which was the grain of sand that turned it from “heap” to “not heap”?”\n\n\n\n\n“a “Kalman filter”—an algorithm that takes various measurements, uses them to estimate some unknown quantity that you want to know, and then uses that estimate to make predictions.”\n\n\n\n\n“wants to minimize the surprise it receives from those predictions being wrong. But the difference is that if new information comes in that suggests your brain is wrong about getting wet—you see that it’s raining, for instance—it has two ways of dealing with it. It can change the world so that its predictions are true, by grabbing an umbrella, or it can change its predictions so that they meet the world, by accepting that you will get wet. It can update its priors.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChivers, Tom. 2024. Everything Is Predictable. Atria/One Signal Publishers.",

Before you submitted a tax return, you could apply the formula to see if you would be audited. If an audit was predicted, but you could see a way to “amend” your return until the formula no longer predicted an audit, you probably would do so. If an audit was unavoidable, you would choose to tell the truth. The result of the IRS being completely predictable is that it would audit exactly the wrong people. All those audited would have anticipated their fate and chosen to act honestly, while those spared an audit would have only their consciences to watch over them. When the IRS audit formula is somewhat fuzzy, everyone stands some risk of an audit; this gives an added incentive for honesty. Highlight(yellow) - 1.

Prisoners’ Dilemmas and How to Resolve Them &gt; Page 100 · Location 1656 The game we have here is a cousin to the prisoners’ dilemma, a life and death case of the “stag hunt” game analyzed by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.* In the stag hunt, if everyone works together to capture the stag, they succeed and all eat well. A problem arises if some hunters come across a hare along the way. If too many hunters are sidetracked chasing after hares, there won’t be enough hunters left to capture the stag. In that case, everyone will do better chasing after rabbits. The best strategy is to go after the stag if and only if you can be confident that most everyone is doing the same thing. You have no reason not to chase after the stag, except if you lack confidence in what others will do. Highlight(yellow) - 4.

Choice and Chance &gt; Page 157 · Location 2454 Suppose you are the kicker in the soccer example, and the goalie is using his best mix: Left 41.7 percent and Right 58.3 percent of the time. Then you will score a goal 79.6 percent of the time whether you kick to the Left, the Right, or any mixture of the two. Observing this, you might be tempted to spare yourself the calculation of your own best mix, just stick to any one action, and rely on the other player using his best mix. The problem is that unless you use your best mix, the other does not have the incentive to go on using his. If you stick to the Left, for example, the goalie will switch to covering the Left also. The reason why you should use your best mix is to keep the other player using his. Highlight(yellow) - 5.

You want to keep the size as low as possible to minimize the cost to you in the event that things go wrong and you have to go through with the action.

Although his soldiers were vastly outnumbered, they had no choice but to fight and win. “Had [Cortés] failed, it might well seem an act of madness…. Yetit was the fruit of deliberate calculation.

Be About It. &gt; Page 16 · Location 310 As the Stoics said, it’s a waste of time to speculate or argue about what makes a good man, a good athlete, a good teammate. Our job, they said, is to be one. Highlight(yellow) - January 14: Where Do They Learn to Judge? &gt; Page 18 · Location 336 You would never say something cruel to someone’s face, so why are you saying it behind their back? Especially when your kids can hear you.

Is your example calling them to be better or worse? Highlight(yellow) - January 22: They Are Always Listening &gt; Page 26 · Location 444 Kids are always watching, eyes, ears, and heart open.

I’m proud of you. It’s you I like. You are special. You are enough. You’re the most important thing in the world to me. Highlight(yellow) - February 4: Love Is About Service &gt; Page 42 · Location 612 Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed. Highlight(yellow) - February 4: Love Is About Service &gt; Page 42 · Location 621 You’re here to serve. Highlight(yellow) - February 6: It Takes Discipline &gt; Page 44 · Location 647 by keeping your word to yourself, to your children, you are strengthening an important muscle. Highlight(yellow) - February 8: They Don’t Have to Make You Proud &gt; Page 46 · Location 672 Our kids don’t owe us anything. After all, they didn’t ask to be here. It is we who are obligated to them, by virtue of our choice to bring them into this world. Highlight(yellow) - February 9: Here’s How to Tie Your Family Together &gt; Page 47 · Location 685 “Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parent.” Highlight(yellow) - February 12: Love the Kid You Have &gt; Page 50 · Location 724 They should know that they are special for who they are, that they make the world—and your life—better just by being in it.

For who they are, for what they choose to be. Not for who or what you want them to become. Highlight(yellow) - February 14: The Greatest Thing You Can Do &gt; Page 52 · Location 746 “One of the greatest things a father can do for his children,” Howard W. Hunter once said, “is to love their mother.” Highlight(yellow) - February 15: This Is What They Most Want &gt; Page 53 · Location 765 To let them know that they are loved, that they are special, that they are enough. To give them the attention and admiration they deserve. Highlight(yellow) - February 16: Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing &gt; Page 54 · Location 776 The main thing is for them to be healthy, to be prepared for life, to have good values, to have a good sense of who they are and what they want to spend their life doing. The main, main, main, main thing is to love them and for them to feel loved. Highlight(yellow) - February 20: These Are the Richest Kids &gt; Page 58 · Location 830 All of us have the ability to give our kids a rich life. We can measure wealth in the time and attention they get from us. By whether they feel safe and secure, whether their house feels like a home. Even if we only make $ 30,000 a year. Highlight(yellow) - February 21: Always Be Their Friend &gt; Page 59 · Location 845 There are going to be things in your life that are very hard. But you’re not alone. I’ll always be your friend. Highlight(yellow) - February 25: Hit Them with One of These &gt; Page 63 · Location 885 They think you’re going to remind them about some piece of schoolwork. Or criticize what they’re wearing. Or tell them to stop roughhousing. No, you’re going to hit them with those words we can’t say often enough: I love you. Put Your Family First: (Work, Family, Scene: Pick Two) Highlight(yellow) - March 4: You Have to Make Adjustments &gt; Page 74 · Location 988 Family comes first. Before business Highlight(yellow) - March 6: This Is What Putting Them First Looks Like &gt; Page 76 · Location 1017 What could it look like if you put your family first? If you really put them ahead of everything else? You can’t be sure exactly until you do it, but you can be certain that it will feel great. Highlight(yellow) - March 19: Don’t Do This to Them &gt; Page 89 · Location 1183 Our kids shouldn’t just be expected to deal with it. They should be communicated to and informed with respect. They deserve an explanation for the things that keep us away from them, that keep them away from the things that it is our adult responsibility to provide. It’s a matter of duty, to be sure, but more important, it’s a matter of trust. Highlight(yellow) - March 22: They Are Your Work &gt; Page 92 · Location 1215 “You are not an interruption of my work. You are my work.” Highlight(yellow) - March 29: Here’s How to Spend More Time with Them &gt; Page 99 · Location 1312 We can spend more time with our kids. We can be there more than we are. We just have to be comfortable making less money. Master Your Emotions: (Lessons in Patience and Self-Control) Highlight(yellow) - April 1: Always Grab the Right Handle &gt; Page 105 · Location 1349 Every day, with every situation, there is a choice. Which handle will we grab? Which handle will we show our kids how to grab? The easy one? Or the right one? Highlight(yellow) - April 2: Your Job Is to Make Fast Transitions &gt; Page 106 · Location 1357 your job is not to walk into that house and carry with you anything that came from before. Highlight(yellow) - April 10: Embrace This Mindset &gt; Page 114 · Location 1456 In Tibet, Buddhist monks make beautiful mandalas out of sand. They spend hours, even days, crafting these complex, geometric designs . . . only to wipe them clean and start over as soon as they’re finished. Highlight(yellow) - April 10: Embrace This Mindset &gt; Page 114 · Location 1463 we like that it’s a little bit like Groundhog Day. We love that it means a chance to wake up and do this with them again. Highlight(yellow) - April 18: This Is the Enemy &gt; Page 122 · Location 1568 Preoccupation is the enemy of good parenting. Highlight(yellow) - April 20: It’s Not Fair &gt; Page 124 · Location 1596 They’re not going to be perfect. They’re going to have our weaknesses . . . perhaps some of their own too. And to punish them with our unrealistic expectations, even unintentionally, quite literally for the sins of the father, is profoundly unfair. Highlight(yellow) - April 23: Don’t Thrust Them Away &gt; Page 127 · Location 1631 Even teenagers don’t fully comprehend the concept of consequences, of cause and effect. (Why do you think they drive like crazy, eat like crap, and talk all kinds of trash?) What they do comprehend is you getting upset, you pulling away. Highlight(yellow) - April 23: Don’t Thrust Them Away &gt; Page 127 · Location 1636 You can gently unwrap their arms from your throat. You can get a new shirt. You can turn the game around and chase them instead. You can make what was annoying become fun. You can talk to them calmly, correct them, and then gently turn the pain into a moment of profound connection. That’s entirely up to you. Highlight(yellow) - April 24: What if Someone Else Treated Your Kids This Way? &gt; Page 128 · Location 1649 Your job isn’t just to protect your kids from other people. It’s to protect them from your own bad habits, your own temper, your own flaws too. It’s to demand of yourself what you’d expect from anyone to whom you’d entrust your children’s safety. That is to say: you have to demand the best of yourself. Highlight(yellow) - April 25: Delay, Delay, Delay &gt; Page 129 · Location 1666 Teach them that it’s possible to control how you react. Highlight(yellow) - April 27: You’re the Voice in Their Heads &gt; Page 131 · Location 1690 Everything we say, every interaction we have with our kids, is shaping them. How we speak to them informs how they will speak to themselves. If you want proof of this, think about all the complexes and scripts you picked up from your parents—maybe things you’re working on in therapy right now, decades later. Highlight(yellow) - April 27: You’re the Voice in Their Heads &gt; Page 131 · Location 1694 Speak to them the way you’d want them to speak to themselves. Because it’s not a matter of if they will internalize the things they heard growing up; it’s a matter of what they will internalize. Put a good voice in their head so they might remember the good stuff. Character Is Fate: (Lessons in Right and Wrong) Highlight(yellow) - May 5: Everything You Do Is Teaching Them &gt; Page 143 · Location 1799 Punishment teaches the child only how to punish. Scolding teaches him how to scold. By showing him that we understand, we teach him to understand. By helping him, we teach him to help. He learns cooperation by cooperating.

How do you feel about it, Tracee?” Highlight(yellow) - May 12: What Matters More Than Results &gt; Page 150 · Location 1888 Are you teaching them that test scores matter or that learning counts? Are you teaching them that success is winning arbitrary competitions or that it is becoming the best version of themselves? Highlight(yellow) - May 13: Ask Them This Question Every Day &gt; Page 151 · Location 1904 What was something you did for someone else? Who did you help? Highlight(yellow) - May 15: Teach Them Empathy &gt; Page 153 · Location 1930 “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” Highlight(yellow) - May 19: Teach Them to Be Bigger &gt; Page 157 · Location 1985 what mattered was what he said and did. What mattered was responding with kindness and love. What mattered was knowing that he was good and that he was loved and nothing anyone else thought could change that. Lawson’s parents gave him the gift of teaching him that he was bigger than the small people who lived around him. Highlight(yellow) - May 20: Don’t Just Assume It Will Work Out &gt; Page 158 · Location 1999 Kids don’t just “turn out” as good people. They are made that way—molded, guided by ancestors, taught by example, and buoyed by a constancy of parental presence. Highlight(yellow) - May 25: Are You Teaching Them Values? &gt; Page 163 · Location 2067 The purpose of education is not to make your kids more selfish, more greedy, more convinced of their own ideas or superiority. No, it’s to make them better citizens, better human beings, and hopefully, someday, better parents themselves. Highlight(yellow) - May 27: The Main Thing We Have to Teach Them &gt; Page 165 · Location 2094 The way to raise decent and kind human beings is to teach them how their actions affect other people, what their obligations to other people are. You don’t have to be a philosopher to pull that off . . . just a good and decent person yourself. Don’t Neglect Yourself: (Lessons in Self-Care) Highlight(yellow) - June 13: Try Not to Give Them Anything Extra &gt; Page 185 · Location 2332 The Buddhists speak of samsara, the way that suffering transfers from generation to generation. Highlight(yellow) - June 25: You Would Tell Them This. So Tell Yourself Too. &gt; Page 197 · Location 2503 You still have so much time in front of you. So much ability, so much potential to fulfill. You decide the rest of the story. It’s up to you. But this is the important part: the story you decide for yourself is also going to determine what kind of stories your kids believe. Your story is the compass and the map on the journey that will lead them to realism, optimism, skepticism, cynicism, or fatalism. Highlight(yellow) - June 26: You Have to Face Your Flaws &gt; Page 198 · Location 2517 If you want to be a great parent, you’re going to have to deal with your crap. You can’t carry baggage—it’s too dangerous with a kid around. You risk dropping it on them. There can be no more hiding, no more deferring. The bill is due and you have to pay it: in therapy, in conversations with your spouse, in the pages of your journal. You have to face your flaws. Because there are little people who did not choose to be stuck in the same house with you and should not have to be trapped with a monster or a brick wall for a parent. Help Them Become Who They Are: (Lessons in Nurturing and Discovery) Highlight(yellow) - July 2: Help Them Become Who They Are &gt; Page 208 · Location 2603 We expose them to things, we let them find what interests them, and then we support those interests. Highlight(yellow) - July 4: Don’t Tie Down Your Eagle &gt; Page 210 · Location 2625 You can’t hold your children back. You can’t resent that they’re different. You can’t hold them back with antiquated notions about gender or class. Their choices say nothing about your choices. They are their own people. They deserve their own lives. They deserve your support and encouragement in whatever direction that takes you or them. Highlight(yellow) - July 6: You Have to Do This. We Need It. &gt; Page 212 · Location 2649 Our job is to keep our kids the way they were born, which as The Road was written to show us, means fundamentally good. Innocent. Pure. Highlight(yellow) - July 9: Don’t Let Them Wish to Not Be Who They Are &gt; Page 215 · Location 2691 Through your words, your actions, and your choices, you must teach and prove to them that they make the world better just by being in it and by being themselves. Highlight(yellow) - July 10: Work with Them to Find Their Lane &gt; Page 216 · Location 2705 Our job as parents is to put our kids in environments in which they can thrive and blossom. Our job is to work with them to find their lane. That environment may not be the first school we drop them into. It might take several tries and a fair amount of experimentation. It will definitely take patience. That doesn’t matter. Highlight(yellow) - July 11: Let Them Decide &gt; Page 217 · Location 2723 When your kids feel a pull toward something creative or fulfilling, the worst thing you can do as a parent is prevent them from going in that direction. Highlight(yellow) - July 12: Don’t Judge Them Too Harshly . . . or Quickly &gt; Page 218 · Location 2738 We are not nearly as good at evaluating ability and predicting the future as we think we are. So we have to be forgiving. We can’t jump to conclusions. We have to give kids the benefit of the doubt. We have to root for them, not write them off. Highlight(yellow) - July 13: Teach Them to Choose &gt; Page 219 · Location 2752 Teach them how to choose. Empower them. Make sure they know how to decide, and to be okay with their decision even if they decide wrong. It doesn’t matter that you know more. What matters is that you let them learn. Highlight(yellow) - July 24: You Have to Listen &gt; Page 230 · Location 2905 That little fellow is always trying to tell you things. Of course, it’s not always explicit. Sometimes “I want to learn to be useful” comes out as “I want to learn to vacuum.” Sometimes “I want to be a good friend” comes out as “Can you drive me to Bobby’s house?” Sometimes “I want to be a writer” comes out as an awkward kid who doesn’t want to watch sports with you. Highlight(yellow) - July 26: What Are You Making Them Do? &gt; Page 232 · Location 2927 We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore, excellence is not an act but a habit. Highlight(yellow) - July 29: Do Not Get in the Way of Their Primal Inclinations &gt; Page 235 · Location 2972 Don’t force your interests on your child. Pay attention to their natural, primal inclinations, then foster their blossoming. Always Be a Fan: (The Greatest Gift You Can Give Them) Highlight(yellow) - August 1: You Can Give Them This Gift &gt; Page 241 · Location 3011 “My father,” Jim would later say in his legendary ESPY speech, “gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person: he believed in me.” Highlight(yellow) - August 21: Don’t Care More Than They Do &gt; Page 261 · Location 3271 There is a wisdom to their innocence—defer to it, or at least respect it enough not to corrupt it. Highlight(yellow) - August 23: They Don’t Need a Lecture. They Need This. &gt; Page 263 · Location 3300 What you really wanted—what you needed—was for someone to see why you were doing these things. You needed someone to guide you back to the right path and to help you realize the consequences of being off it. Struggle and Emerge: (How to Raise Their Resilience) Highlight(yellow) - October 12: Teach Them That They Decide the End of Every Story &gt; Page 320 · Location 3942 Teach them to see hardship as fuel. Teach them to see an opportunity where others see an obstacle. Teach them that despite everything outside their control, they retain an incredible power: the power to choose what they do with what happens to them. They get to decide what role an event will play in their life. They have the power to write the end of their own story. Highlight(yellow) - October 22: How You See It Matters &gt; Page 330 · Location 4072 Will your children be affected by things that happen? By having to change teachers midyear because of a move? By having glasses? By a divorce? By their learning issues? Yes. It would be dishonest to claim otherwise. But negatively affected? That’s up to you. Because how you decide to see it and, more important, how you choose to respond are going to determine how your children perceive these events as well. Highlight(yellow) - October 26: Don’t Deprive Them of This &gt; Page 334 · Location 4117 Some kids are extroverts. Some are introverts. But every kid needs to know how to be alone and to be happy in that space. There are lots of opportunities for you to help them develop this ability, depending on their age and personality, of course. When they start stirring in the morning, don’t rush in. When they’re quietly playing in their room, take a step back. Let them be bored. Highlight(yellow) - October 27: Let Them Know About Your Battles &gt; Page 335 · Location 4133 There has never been a parent (or a human being) who didn’t have their own battles. If we don’t explain this to our children, if we can’t be vulnerable or honest with them, there will forever be an unbridgeable gap between us. Time Flies: (You Could Leave Life Right Now) Highlight(yellow) - December 14: Is It Really Time to Go? &gt; Page 390 · Location 4772 Encourage your kids. Resist the urge to hurry. It’s not really time to go. You’re exactly where you—and they—need to be.",

For he has not been allowed to put himself to the test.”\n\n\n\n\n“Do not, I implore you, live in dread of what the immortal gods apply like spurs to our souls: disaster is the opportunity for true worth.”\n\n\n\n\n“So the bodies of mariners are tough from the buffeting of the sea, the hands of farmers calloused, the muscles of soldiers strong to enable them to hurl the javelin, the legs of athletes agile: in each case the part of the body exercised is the strongest.”\n\n\n\n\n“In no way can God better cast doubt on what we desire than by awarding those things to the most disreputable men and denying them to the best.”\n\n\n\n\n“What is the duty of a good man? To offer himself to fate.”\n\n\n\n\n“Inside I have given you every good; your good fortune consists in not needing good fortune.”\n\n\n\n\n“Surely every man will want to restrain any impulse towards anger when he realizes that it begins by inflicting harm, firstly, on himself!”\n\n\n\n\n“Mind is weighed down by the body when it is worn and weak;”\n\n\n\n\n“Not all men are wounded in the same place; and so you ought to know what part of you is weak, so you can give it the most protection.”\n\n\n\n\n“Anger often comes to us, but more often we come to it.”\n\n\n\n\n“No one keeps himself waiting; and yet the greatest cure for anger is to wait, so that the initial passion it engenders may die down, and the fog that shrouds the mind may subside, or become less thick. Some of the affronts that were sweeping you off your feet will lose their edge in an hour, not just in a day, others will disappear altogether; if the delay you sought produces no effect, it will be clear that judgement now rules, not anger.”\n\n\n\n\n“Moreover, let us change all its symptoms into the opposite: let the expression on our faces be relaxed, our voices gentler, our steps more measured; little by little outer features mould inner ones.”\n\n\n\n\n“It is the mark of true greatness not to feel when you have received a blow.”\n\n\n\n\n“No one who looks at another man’s possessions takes pleasure in his own: for this reason we grow angry even with the gods, because someone is in front of us, forgetting how many men are behind us and what a massive load of envy follows at the back of those who envy a few.”\n\n\n\n\n“But what opinion adds to our grief exceeds Nature’s prescription.”\n\n\n\n\n“Whatever fate one man can strike can come to all of us alike.”\n\n\n\n\n“The man who has anticipated the coming of troubles takes away their power when they arrive.”\n\n\n\n\n“Let us suppose that the dead are merely absent, so deceiving ourselves; we have sent them away, or, rather, we have sent them ahead and we will join them soon.”\n\n\n\n\n“Death is a release from all pains, and a boundary beyond which our sufferings cannot go; it returns us to that state of peacefulness in which we lay before we were born.”\n\n\n\n\n“When growth is no longer possible, the end draws near.”\n\n\n\n\n“There is, therefore, no reason for you to rush off to your son’s tomb: his worst elements lie there, those that troubled him most in life, bones and ashes that are no more parts of him than were the clothes and other things that gave his body protection.”\n\n\n\n\n“You ask what I seek from virtue? Virtue herself.”\n\n\n\n\n“I am satisfied if each day I make some reduction in the number of my vices and find fault with my mistakes.”\n\n\n\n\n“Where indeed will Fortune find a safer place to store wealth than with someone who will give it back without complaint when she asks for its return?”\n\n\n\n\n“He does not love wealth but he would rather have it; he does not admit it into his heart but into his home, and what wealth is his he does not reject but keeps, wishing it to supply greater scope for him to practise his virtue.”\n\n\n\n\n“The giving of money should have this status: no return should be asked but a return can be made.”\n\n\n\n\n“Is it not equally clear that generosity, moderation, and kindness find themselves on a downward path?”\n\n\n\n\n“Even if others hold the front line and fate has placed you among the third row of soldiers, play your part from where you stand with your voice, your encouragement, your example, your spirit: even if his hands have been chopped off, a man finds something to do for his side in battle if he stands there nonetheless and shouts support.”\n\n\n\n\n“Envy together with a thousand other craven vices reign in a city when it is flourishing and prosperous.”\n\n\n\n\n“Natural abilities do not respond well to compulsion; when Nature is in opposition, labour is fruitless.”\n\n\n\n\n“In selecting friends we shall pay attention to their characters so that we may enlist as few as possible who suffer from impurities: it is the beginning of disease to combine what is sick and what is healthy.”\n\n\n\n\n“Since we do not have so much strength of character, we should at least reduce the scale of our possessions, so that we may be less exposed to the injustices of Fortune.”\n\n\n\n\n“Where money is concerned, the ideal amount is one that does not fall into poverty and yet is not far removed from poverty.”\n\n\n\n\n“I thank you for what I have possessed and kept. It has brought me considerable reward to manage your property, but, as this is your command, I give it up, I surrender it with gratitude and pleasure. If you want me to have anything of yours even now, I will look after it; if you desire something else, I return to you my silver, both wrought and coined, my house, and my household.”\n\n\n\n\n“We must allow our minds some relaxation: if rested, they will rise up the better and sharper to challenges. As one should not impose a strict regimen on rich fields—for, if their fertility is never granted remission, it will quickly exhaust them—so unremitting effort will shatter the mind’s vigour, while it will regain strength if it is allowed a small release and relaxation; mental effort permanently sustained produces in the mind a certain sluggishness and lethargy.”\n\n\n\n\n“We do not receive a life that is short, but rather we make it so; we are not beggars in it, but spendthrifts.”\n\n\n\n\n“Everyone rushes his life on, and suffers from a yearning for the future and a boredom with the present. But that man who devotes every hour to his own needs, who plans every day as if it were his last, neither longs for nor fears tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n“The greatest obstacle to living is expectation, which depends on tomorrow and wastes today. What lies in the hands of Fortune you deal with, what lies in your own hands you let slip. Where are you looking? Where are you bending your aim? All that is still to come lies in doubt: live here and now!”\n\n\n\n\n“In wretched mortals’ life the fairest day Is first to flee alway.”\n\n\n\n\n“We are accustomed to say it was not in our power to choose the parents we were allotted, that chance gave them to us: but we are allowed to be born from whatever parents we wish.”\n\n\n\n\n“No one is the object of another man’s contempt, unless he is first the object of his own.”\n\n\n\n\n“It is a dangerous thing, believe me, to reveal to a state how much wicked men are in the majority.”\n\n\n\n\n“Mercy consists in controlling the mind when one has the power to take revenge, or in the forbearance of a superior towards an inferior in determining punishment.”\n\n\n\n\n“Mercy has freedom to decide; not the letter of the law, but what is fair and good determines the sentence it passes; it has power to acquit and to assess the damages at whatever value it pleases.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeneca, Lucius. 2007.
