You have to focus on the practice of listening with all your attention, your whole being: your eyes, ears, body, and your mind. If you just pretend to listen, and do not listen with one hundred percent of yourself, the other person will know it and will not find relief from his suffering. If you know how to practice mindful breathing and can stay focused on the desire to help him find relief, then you will be able to sustain your compassion while listening.”"

He is also a professor of economics at George Mason University and a well-known commentator on economic issues. Roberts is known for his popular economics podcast “EconTalk,” in which he interviews leading economists and discusses a wide range of economic topics. Source: chatgpt.\n\n“Normal human beings have trouble making decisions, and when we do, we often will come up with reasons that are merely an after-the-fact narrative—something we tell ourselves and others to justify what we’ve done or plan to do.”\n\n\n“Nothing cancels out betraying who you are or who you aspire to be. So you can’t add ”losing respect for myself” as one of the costs of keeping the diamond.”\n\n\n“Normal human beings have trouble making decisions, and when we do, we often will come up with reasons that are merely an after-the-fact narrative—something we tell ourselves and others to justify what we’ve done or plan to do.”\n\n\n“My wife went shopping at REI for gear that she needed for a five-day hiking trip she planned with her sister. The salesperson wanted to know if it was going to be a Type 1 or Type 2 experience. The difference? A Type 1 experience is nice the whole time—nothing too stressful, mostly positive. You enjoy it while you’re in the middle of it and you enjoy it after. A day at the beach. A walk in the park. A Type 2 experience is hard. There are moments of pain that have to be endured—difficult days with a lot of altitude gained over a fairly short distance, streams to be crossed without your shoes where the water runs so cold your feet go numb while you’re crossing, heavy gear to be carried on the trek that hurts your back or feet.”\n\n\n“So the narrow utilitarian part of the decision wasn’t irrelevant. But the flourishing part of the decision was the decisive one. I took the job because I felt like it was something I was meant to do, a calling. To turn down the opportunity would have felt like a betrayal of the deepest parts of me.”\n\n\n“You might respond by saying that it’s wrong to”settle,” to be content with someone who is merely OK rather than someone great. Actually, I’m saying something worse. I’m not encouraging you to settle; I’m telling you that you have to settle. The best spouse/partner/career/city doesn’t exist and it’s not just because they’re hard to find. It’s not a meaningful concept.”\n\n\n“Start by facing your ignorance. Wild problems are not the kinds of problems with answers. And that’s OK. It’s better than OK. It’s glorious, something like going to Rome for the first and only time. Sure, some of us would love for someone to give us an itinerary to go with our trip to Rome—a tour bus where all the stops are preplanned because they’re the popular ones. But most of us would prefer to discover for ourselves what we love about Rome and what we might come to love. Wouldn’t you rather be surprised than have it all mapped out for you? And it doesn’t matter, because you can’t map it out anyway.”\n\n\n“This is the idea of Chesterton’s Fence, named for an insight of G. K. Chesterton’s. When you come across something that doesn’t make sense to you—a fence in the middle of nowhere with no apparent purpose—you might be tempted to tear it down. Before you do, you should try to find out why it’s there—it may have a cause or purpose that isn’t obvious.”\n\n\n“Getting over yourself is a good place to start—being aware that you’re not the center of the universe. That requires some level of self-awareness—being aware of how your actions and words affect others and how you’re perceived. Self-awareness can come from therapy, meditation, religion, or reading philosophy or literature.”\n\n\n“Alternatively, you might choose to sublimate your own status or the ability to express yourself in hopes of making your partner shine, or to enhance the experience of all of the dancers out on the floor. You might focus on being part of something larger than yourself, weaving near and around the other dancers in unexpected and delightful ways. When you act tactfully on the dance floor and behave properly, keeping others—your partner and the other couples—in mind, you have a choice in how to think of the experience before, during, and after. You can pride yourself on your selfless behavior or you can see yourself in a more holistic way, as part of something larger than yourself, a fuller, more connected experience.”\n\n\n“In an often told story that is probably apocryphal, the British playwright George Bernard Shaw asks a beautiful woman at a dinner party if she would be willing to go home with him for the night in exchange for one million British pounds. She admits that she would think about it. OK, he responds, how about ten pounds? What do you take me for? she asks, insulted.”We’ve already established that, he responds, we’re just talking price.”\n\n\n“Nothing cancels out betraying who you are or who you aspire to be. So you can’t add”losing respect for myself” as one of the costs of keeping the diamond.”\n\n\n“We can imagine cases where the utilitarian costs and benefits are so large that there comes a point where sense of self is trumped. If Teodora had a child who needed an operation that she couldn’t afford, I could imagine her keeping the diamond even though she would feel guilty. We would not judge her harshly. If anything, that’s the exception that proves the rule—Teodora’s identity as a mother would be another principle at her core competing with honesty. She would put either of those principles ahead of narrow utilitarianism.”\n\n\n“Man wants freedom to become the man he wants to become.” We are in the process of becoming.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Kybalion is a book on the teachings of the Hermetic philosophy, which is a set of spiritual principles that are said to be based on the writings of the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus. The Kybalion was published in 1908 and attributed to three initiates, who are referred to as “the masters” in the book. The identity of the three initiates is unknown and there is some debate about whether they were real individuals or simply pseudonyms used by the book’s author or authors. The Kybalion is a key text in the study of Hermeticism and has been influential in the development of various spiritual and metaphysical movements. It covers a range of topics, including the principles of mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, and causation. Source: chatgpt.\n“These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers. They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in each generation who are ready for the truth, or who would recognize it if it were presented to them.”\n“THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.”\n“As above, so below; as below, so above.”\n“Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.”\n“Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.”\n“Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.”\n“Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.”\n“Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.”\n“These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers. They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in each generation who are ready for the truth, or who would recognize it if it were presented to them.”\n“And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and characteristics, even down”to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, desire for offerings and worship, and all the other survivals from the days of the childhood of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown men and women, and are rapidly being discarded.”\n“Spirit is simply a name that men give to the highest conception of Infinite Living Mind—it means”the Real Essence”—it means Living Mind, as much superior to Life and Mind as we know them, as the latter are superior to mechanical Energy and Matter.”\n“A knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those of other people. He will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will—to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable.”\n“The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student, polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to”refusing” to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a “denial” of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized[…]”\n“But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man’s mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and enjoys but little—he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense suffering.”\n“We do not wish to enter into a consideration of Free Will, or Determinism, in this work, for various reasons. Among the many reasons, is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a man may be both Free and yet bound by Necessity, depending upon the meaning of the terms, and the height of Truth from which the matter is examined. The ancient writers express the matter thus:”The further the creation is from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches, the nearer Free is it.”\n“The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity, environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying,”Why, I certainly am free to act and do as I please—I do just what I want to do,” but they fail to explain whence arise the “want to” and “as I please.” What makes them “want to” do one thing in preference to another; what makes them “please” to do this, and not do that? Is there no “because” to their “pleasing” and “Wanting”? The Master can change these “pleases” and “wants” into others at the opposite end of the mental pole. He is able to “Will to will,” instead of to will because some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a tendency or desire within him so to do.”"

With every step, you can arrive in the present moment, you can step into the Pure Land or into the Kingdom of God. When you are walking from one side of the room to the other, or from one building to another, be aware of the contact of your feet with the earth and be aware of the contact of the air as it enters your body. It may help you to discover how many steps you can make comfortably during an in-breath and how many during an out-breath. As you breathe in, you can say”in,” and as you breathe out, you can say ”out.”\n\n\n\n\n“To learn how to live each moment of our daily life in deep mindfulness and concentration is the practice.”\n\n\n\n\n“You have to be aware that your emotion is just an emotion. It comes, stays for some time, and then goes away.”\n\n\n\n\n“Let us bring our attention down to our belly and breathe in and out. This storm will go away, so don’t be afraid.”\n\n\n\n\n“When you remove the embargo and the blocks of pain come up, you will have to suffer a bit. There is no way to avoid it. And that is why the Buddha said that you have to learn how to embrace this pain. It is for this reason that the practice of mindfulness is so important. You generate a strong source of energy so that you can recognize, embrace, and take care of these negative energies.”\n\n\n\n\n“If you see elements of garbage in you, like fear, despair, and hatred, don’t panic. As a good organic gardener, a good practitioner, you can face this:”I recognize that there is garbage in me.

I want you to know it.” This expresses faithfulness to your commitment. ”Darling, I am doing my best. I am taking good care of my anger. For me and for you also. I don’t want to explode, to destroy myself and destroy you. I am doing my best. I am putting into practice what I have learned from my teacher, from my sangha.” This faithfulness will inspire respect and confidence in the other party. And lastly, Darling, I need your help.” This is a very strong statement, because usually when you’re angry, you have the tendency to say, ”I don’t need you.”\n\n\n“Darling, I suffer, and I want you to know it. Darling, I am doing my best. I’m trying not to blame anyone else, including you. Since we are so close to each other, since we have made a commitment to each other, I feel that I need your support and your help to get out of this state of suffering, of anger.”\n\n\n“Anger is in us in the form of a seed. The seeds of love and compassion are also there. In our consciousness, there are many negative seeds and also many positive seeds. The practice is to avoid watering the negative seeds, and to identify and water the positive seeds every day. This is the practice of love.”\n\n\n“If you can remind yourself that the positive elements are still present within you and the other person, you will know that it is possible to break through, so that the best things in both of you can come up and manifest again.”\n\n\n“My dear child, I know you suffer a lot. For many years, you have suffered a lot. When you suffer, I suffer, too. How can I be happy when my child suffers? So I recognize that both you and I suffer. Can we do something about it? Can we come together and search for a solution? Can we talk? I really want to restore communication, but alone, I cannot do much. I need your help.”\n\n\n“There are moments when we feel very grateful for the other person in our life. We deeply appreciate his or her presence. We are full of compassion, gratitude, and love. We have experienced moments like this in our life. We feel so grateful that the other person is still alive, that she is still with us, and has stood by our side during very difficult times. I would suggest that if such a moment happens again, take advantage of it. To truly profit from this time, withdraw to a place where you can be alone with yourself. Don’t just go to the other person and say,”I’m grateful you are there.” That is not enough. You can do this later. Right at that moment, it is better to withdraw into your room or to a quiet place, and immerse yourself in that feeling of gratitude. Then write down your feelings, your gratitude, your happiness. In half a page or one page, do your best to express yourself in writing, or record yourself on tape.”\n\n\n“When we’re angry with someone, we want to hurt them. Giving them a present changes that into wanting to make them happy. So, when you are angry with someone, send him a present. After you have sent it, you will stop being angry with him. It’s very simple, and it always works.”\n\n\n“Most of our suffering is born from our lack of understanding and insight that there is no separate self.

They are also called knots because they tie us up and obstruct our freedom. When someone insults us, or does something unkind to us, an internal formation is created in our consciousness. If you don’t know how to undo the internal knot and transform it, the knot will stay there for a long time. And the next time someone says something or does something to you of the same nature, that internal formation will grow stronger. As knots or blocks of pain in us, our internal formations have the power to push us, to dictate our behavior.”\n\n\n“When our child is drowning in a strong emotion, we can hold his or her hand and say,”My dear one, breathe. Breathe in and out with Mommy, with Daddy.” We can also invite our child to do walking meditation with us, gently taking her hand and helping her calm down, with each step. When you give your child some of your mindfulness energy, she will be able to calm down very quickly and embrace her emotions.”\n\n\n“Let us use a house to represent our consciousness. We can identify two parts: the basement is the store consciousness and the living area is mind consciousness. Internal formations, like anger, rest in the store consciousness—in the basement—in the form of a seed, until you hear, see, read, or think of something that touches your seed of anger. Then it comes up and manifests on the level of your mind consciousness, your living room. It manifests as a zone of energy that makes the atmosphere in your living room heavy and unpleasant. When the energy of anger comes up, we suffer.”\n\n\n“Our blocks of pain, sorrow, anger, and despair always want to come up into our mind consciousness, into our living room, because they have grown big and need our attention. They want to emerge, but we don’t want them to come up because they are painful to look at. So we try to block their way. We want them to stay asleep down in the basement. Because we do not want to face them, our habit is to fill our living room with other guests. But whenever we have ten or fifteen minutes of free time, and we don’t know what to do, these internal knots will come up and make a mess in the living room. To avoid this, we pick up a book, we turn on the television, we go for a drive, we do anything to keep our living room occupied.

    "text": "1.3 The Source of Anger\n\n\n“In our consciousness there are blocks of pain, anger, and frustration called internal formations. They are also called knots because they tie us up and obstruct our freedom. When someone insults us, or does something unkind to us, an internal formation is created in our consciousness. If you don’t know how to undo the internal knot and transform it, the knot will stay there for a long time. And the next time someone says something or does something to you of the same nature, that internal formation will grow stronger. As knots or blocks of pain in us, our internal formations have the power to push us, to dictate our behavior.”\n\n\n\n\n“Let us use a house to represent our consciousness. We can identify two parts: the basement is the store consciousness and the living area is mind consciousness. Internal formations, like anger, rest in the store consciousness—in the basement—in the form of a seed, until you hear, see, read, or think of something that touches your seed of anger. Then it comes up and manifests on the level of your mind consciousness, your living room. It manifests as a zone of energy that makes the atmosphere in your living room heavy and unpleasant. When the energy of anger comes up, we suffer.”\n\n\n\n\n“Our blocks of pain, sorrow, anger, and despair always want to come up into our mind consciousness, into our living room, because they have grown big and need our attention. They want to emerge, but we don’t want them to come up because they are painful to look at. So we try to block their way. We want them to stay asleep down in the basement. Because we do not want to face them, our habit is to fill our living room with other guests. But whenever we have ten or fifteen minutes of free time, and we don’t know what to do, these internal knots will come up and make a mess in the living room. To avoid this, we pick up a book, we turn on the television, we go for a drive, we do anything to keep our living room occupied. When the living room is occupied, these unpleasant internal formations will not come up.”"

This is the practice of love.”\n\n\n\n\n“When we’re angry with someone, we want to hurt them. Giving them a present changes that into wanting to make them happy. So, when you are angry with someone, send him a present. After you have sent it, you will stop being angry with him. It’s very simple, and it always works.”\n\n\n\n\n“There are moments when we feel very grateful for the other person in our life. We deeply appreciate his or her presence. We are full of compassion, gratitude, and love. We have experienced moments like this in our life. We feel so grateful that the other person is still alive, that she is still with us, and has stood by our side during very difficult times. I would suggest that if such a moment happens again, take advantage of it. To truly profit from this time, withdraw to a place where you can be alone with yourself. Don’t just go to the other person and say,”I’m grateful you are there.” That is not enough. You can do this later. Right at that moment, it is better to withdraw into your room or to a quiet place, and immerse yourself in that feeling of gratitude. Then write down your feelings, your gratitude, your happiness. In half a page or one page, do your best to express yourself in writing, or record yourself on tape.”\n\n\n\n\n“If you can remind yourself that the positive elements are still present within you and the other person, you will know that it is possible to break through, so that the best things in both of you can come up and manifest again.”"

He will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will—to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable.”\n\n\n\n\n“The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student, polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to”refusing” to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a ”denial” of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized.”\n\n\n\n\n“But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man’s mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and enjoys but little—he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense suffering.”"

Among the many reasons, is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a man may be both Free and yet bound by Necessity, depending upon the meaning of the terms, and the height of Truth from which the matter is examined. The ancient writers express the matter thus:”The further the creation is from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches, the nearer Free is it.”\n\n\n\n\n“The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity, environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying,”Why, I certainly am free to act and do as I please—I do just what I want to do,” but they fail to explain whence arise the ”want to” and ”as I please.” What makes them ”want to” do one thing in preference to another; what makes them ”please” to do this, and not do that? Is there no ”because” to their ”pleasing” and ”Wanting”? The Master can change these ”pleases” and ”wants” into others at the opposite end of the mental pole. He is able to ”Will to will,” instead of to will because some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a tendency or desire within him so to do.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiates, Three. 1908.

Then if someone is deprived of that, what reason is left for you to be angry with him?”\n\n\n\n\n“Whoever keeps this fact clearly in mind, then, that for human beings the present impression is the measure of every action. An impression that may besides be well or badly formed. If well, that person is beyond reproach. If badly, he himself pays the penalty, since it is impossible that one person should go astray and another one pay the penalty for it. Whoever keeps this in mind then will never be angry with anyone and will never abuse, never criticize, never hate, and never offend anyone.”"

But he has paid a high price for the lamp, since he returned for a lamp he has become a thief, in return for a lamp, a man of bad faith, in return for a lamp, a wild beast. That struck him as a good bargain!”"

No this is what you should say: ‘Ensure that my mind will be able to adapt itself to whatever comes about.’ For the former request amounts to the same as an illiterate person asking, ‘tell me what to write when some name is set for me to write.’ Suppose I tell him to write ‘Dion’, and teacher comes along and sets him not to that name, but ‘Theon’, what will come of it? What is he to write? But if you studied how to write, you’ll be ready for everything that may be dictated to you; and if not, what advice should I give you now? If the circumstances should dictate something different, what will you say, what will you do? Keep this general principle in mind, then, and you will never be in need of advice. But if you’re constantly hankering after external things, you’re sure to be tested this way and that in accordance with your master’s will. And who is your master? Whoever has authority over anything that you’re anxious to gain or avoid.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard, Robin, and Christopher Gill. 2014. “Epictetus: Discourses, Fragments, Handbook.”"

You then become conscious of this “decision” and believe that you are in the process of making it.”"

If this statement means anything, it must be that they could have behaved differently—not on the basis of random influences over which they have no control, but because they, as conscious agents, were free to think and act in other ways. To say that they were free not to rape and murder is to say that they could have resisted the impulse to do so (or could have avoided feeling such an impulse altogether)—with the universe, including their brains, in precisely the same state it was in at the moment they committed their crimes. Assuming that violent criminals have such freedom, we reflexively blame them for their actions. But without it, the place for our blame suddenly vanishes, and even the most terrifying sociopaths begin to seem like victims themselves.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Sam. 2012. Free Will. Simon; Schuster."
