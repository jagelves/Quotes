Lucius Annaeus Seneca, commonly known as Seneca, was a Roman philosopher, statesman, and playwright, born around 4 BCE and dying in 65 CE. He is one of the most prominent figures of Stoic philosophy, known for his writings on ethics, self-control, and practical wisdom. Seneca served as an advisor to the Roman emperor Nero, though he eventually fell out of favor and was forced to commit suicide. His works, including essays, letters, and tragedies, have influenced both ancient and modern philosophical thought. *Source: chatgpt.*
