## On Complaining

1.  "*Yes, but my nose is running. Then what do you have hands for, you slave? Isn't it to be able to wipe your nose? How much better it would be for you to wipe your nose than to find fault*"

2.  "*But unpleasant and distressing things come about in this life. And don't such things come about at Olympia? Aren't you scorched by the heat? Aren't you crowded and jostled? Don't you find it difficult to wash? Don't you get soaked when it rains? Aren't you exposed to no end of uproar and shouting and other irritations? But by balancing all of these things off against the remarkable nature of spectacle, I imagine that you're able to accept and endure them. Come now, haven't you been endowed with faculties that enable you to bear whatever may come about? Haven't you been endowed with greatness of soul? And with courage? And with endurance? If only I have greatness of soul, what reason is left for me to be worried about anything that may come to pass? What can disconcert or trouble me, or seem in any way distressing? Shall I fail to apply my capacities to the end for which I have received them, but instead groan and lament about things that come about?*"

## On Judgements

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*From this day forth, then, whenever we fail to act rightly we'll ascribe the blame to nothing other than the judgment that led us to act as we did, and will endeavor to destroy it and cut it out, even more than with tumors and abscesses of our body. In like fashion we will also ascribe what we do right to the same cause. No longer will we blame slave, or neighbor, or wife, or children as being responsible for any of our ills, since we're now convinced that unless we judge things to be of a certain nature, we don't carry out the actions that follow from that judgment. Now when it comes to forming a judgment, or not forming one, we're the masters of that, and not things outside ourselves.*"

2.  "*So accordingly from this day onward we'll investigate and examine the nature and condition of nothing else at all be it land or slaves or horses or dogs but only of our judgments. You can see then that it's necessary for you to become a student, that creature who is the butt of everyone's laughter, if you really want to subject your opinions to proper examination. And that as you are fully aware, is not the work of a single hour or day.*"

3.  "*Don't you know how small a part you are by comparison to the whole with regard to your body I mean but when it comes to your reason you're not inferior to the gods nor do you fall short of them because the greatness of reason is measured not by height or length but by the quality of its judgments.*"

## Use Your Mind

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*Now if you were ignorant of the purpose for which you possess the power of sight you'd be unfortunate and in a bad way if you close your eyes when colors were presenting themselves; so when you have nobility and greatness of mind to enable you to deal with every circumstance, and yet are ignorant of that, aren't you even more unfortunate and even worse off? Things that the faculty in your possession is well fitted to deal with present themselves to you, and yet you renounce the use of it at the very moment when you should be keeping it open for use and fully attentive. Shouldn't you be giving thanks, rather, to the gods for having enable you to rise above everything that they have placed within your power, and having rendered you accountable only for what is subject to your control? With regard to your parents, they have discharged you from all accountability; and likewise with regard to your brothers and sisters, and to your body, and to your property, and life and death. Well then, what have they made you accountable for? Only for what lies within your power, the right use of your impressions. Why do you charge yourself, then, with things for which you're not accountable? You're merely creating trouble for yourself.*"

## On Understanding

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*This man who has fallen into error and is mistaken about the most important matters, and thus has gone blind, not with regard to the eyesight that distinguishes white from black, but with regard to judgment that distinguishes good from bad. Should someone like this be put to death? If you put the question in that way you'll recognize the inhumanity of the thought that you're expressing and see that it is equivalent to saying, should this blind man then or that deaf one be put to death? For the greatest harm that a person can suffer is the loss of the most valuable goods, and the most valuable thing that anyone can possess is correct choice. Then if someone is deprived of that, what reason is left for you to be angry with him?*"

2.  "*Whoever keeps this fact clearly in mind, then, that for human beings the present impression is the measure of every action. An impression that may besides be well or badly formed. If well, that person is beyond reproach. If badly, he himself pays the penalty, since it is impossible that one person should go astray and another one pay the penalty for it. Whoever keeps this in mind then will never be angry with anyone and will never abuse, never criticize, never hate, and never offend anyone.*"

## A Good Bargain

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*That is why I lost my lamp, because the thief was better than me keeping awake. But he has paid a high price for the lamp, since he returned for a lamp he has become a thief, in return for a lamp, a man of bad faith, in return for a lamp, a wild beast. That struck him as a good bargain!*"

## On Learning

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*For the same reason it is also ridiculous to say 'give me some advice.' What advice should I give you? No this is what you should say: 'Ensure that my mind will be able to adapt itself to whatever comes about.' For the former request amounts to the same as an illiterate person asking, 'tell me what to write when some name is set for me to write.' Suppose I tell him to write 'Dion', and teacher comes along and sets him not to that name, but 'Theon', what will come of it? What is he to write? But if you studied how to write, you'll be ready for everything that may be dictated to you; and if not, what advice should I give you now? If the circumstances should dictate something different, what will you say, what will you do? Keep this general principle in mind, then, and you will never be in need of advice. But if you're constantly hankering after external things, you're sure to be tested this way and that in accordance with your master's will. And who is your master? Whoever has authority over anything that you're anxious to gain or avoid.*"

## On Human Beings

::: {style="color: gray"}
1. "*What are you? A human being. Now if you consider yourself in isolation, it is natural for you to live to an advanced age, to be rich, and to enjoy good health; but if you consider yourself as a human being and as a part of some whole, it may be in the interest of the whole that you should now fall ill, now embark on a voyage and be exposed to danger, now suffer poverty, and perhaps even die before your time. Why do you resent this, then? Don't you know that in isolation of foot is no longer a foot, and that you likewise will no longer be a human being? What, then, is a human being? A part of a city, first of all that which is that which is made up of gods and human beings, then that which is closest to us and which we call a city, which is a microcosm of the universal city.*"

## On Retaliation

::: {style="color: gray"}
1. "*'What then if someone injuries me won't I injure him in return?' Consider first what injury is, and recall what you've heard from the philosophers. If it is the case, then that the good lies in choice, and the bad likewise, see whether what you've just said amounts to this: 'since the person in question has injured himself by inflicting some wrong on me, shouldn't I injure myself by inflicting some wrong on him?' Why don't we picture the matter in some such way as that, instead of counting it as an injury when we suffer some loss with regard to our body or possessions, while counting it as no injury at all where our choice is affected? It is that when one is deceived or commits an injustice, one suffers no pain in one's head, or eyes, or one's hip, nor does one lose any land; and we're concerned about nothing other than things of that kind. As to whether our choice is kept honest and trustworthy, or will On the contrary be shameful and unreliable unreliable, that doesn't cause us the slightest concern, except when it comes to making fine speeches in the classroom. And so the progress that we make extends only to speechifying, and apart from that we advance no not a step further.*"
