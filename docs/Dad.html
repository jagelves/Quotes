Highlight(yellow) - April 23: Don’t Thrust Them Away &gt; Page 127 · Location 1631 Even teenagers don’t fully comprehend the concept of consequences, of cause and effect. (Why do you think they drive like crazy, eat like crap, and talk all kinds of trash?) What they do comprehend is you getting upset, you pulling away. Highlight(yellow) - April 23: Don’t Thrust Them Away &gt; Page 127 · Location 1636 You can gently unwrap their arms from your throat. You can get a new shirt. You can turn the game around and chase them instead. You can make what was annoying become fun. You can talk to them calmly, correct them, and then gently turn the pain into a moment of profound connection. That’s entirely up to you. Highlight(yellow) - April 24: What if Someone Else Treated Your Kids This Way? &gt; Page 128 · Location 1649 Your job isn’t just to protect your kids from other people. It’s to protect them from your own bad habits, your own temper, your own flaws too. It’s to demand of yourself what you’d expect from anyone to whom you’d entrust your children’s safety. That is to say: you have to demand the best of yourself. Highlight(yellow) - April 25: Delay, Delay, Delay &gt; Page 129 · Location 1666 Teach them that it’s possible to control how you react. Highlight(yellow) - April 27: You’re the Voice in Their Heads &gt; Page 131 · Location 1690 Everything we say, every interaction we have with our kids, is shaping them. How we speak to them informs how they will speak to themselves. If you want proof of this, think about all the complexes and scripts you picked up from your parents—maybe things you’re working on in therapy right now, decades later. Highlight(yellow) - April 27: You’re the Voice in Their Heads &gt; Page 131 · Location 1694 Speak to them the way you’d want them to speak to themselves. Because it’s not a matter of if they will internalize the things they heard growing up; it’s a matter of what they will internalize. Put a good voice in their head so they might remember the good stuff.

What mattered was responding with kindness and love. What mattered was knowing that he was good and that he was loved and nothing anyone else thought could change that.

Highlight(yellow) - May 20: Don’t Just Assume It Will Work Out &gt; Page 158 · Location 1999 Kids don’t just “turn out” as good people.

Highlight(yellow) - May 25: Are You Teaching Them Values? &gt; Page 163 · Location 2067 The purpose of education is not to make your kids more selfish, more greedy, more convinced of their own ideas or superiority. No, it’s to make them better citizens, better human beings, and hopefully, someday, better parents themselves. Highlight(yellow) - May 27: The Main Thing We Have to Teach Them &gt; Page 165 · Location 2094 The way to raise decent and kind human beings is to teach them how their actions affect other people, what their obligations to other people are.

You decide the rest of the story. It’s up to you. But this is the important part: the story you decide for yourself is also going to determine what kind of stories your kids believe. Your story is the compass and the map on the journey that will lead them to realism, optimism, skepticism, cynicism, or fatalism. Highlight(yellow) - June 26: You Have to Face Your Flaws &gt; Page 198 · Location 2517 If you want to be a great parent, you’re going to have to deal with your crap. You can’t carry baggage—it’s too dangerous with a kid around. You risk dropping it on them. There can be no more hiding, no more deferring. The bill is due and you have to pay it: in therapy, in conversations with your spouse, in the pages of your journal. You have to face your flaws. Because there are little people who did not choose to be stuck in the same house with you and should not have to be trapped with a monster or a brick wall for a parent.

Our job is to work with them to find their lane. That environment may not be the first school we drop them into. It might take several tries and a fair amount of experimentation. It will definitely take patience. That doesn’t matter. Highlight(yellow) - July 11: Let Them Decide &gt; Page 217 · Location 2723 When your kids feel a pull toward something creative or fulfilling, the worst thing you can do as a parent is prevent them from going in that direction.

Highlight(yellow) - July 13: Teach Them to Choose &gt; Page 219 · Location 2752 Teach them how to choose. Empower them.

Teach them to see an opportunity where others see an obstacle. Teach them that despite everything outside their control, they retain an incredible power: the power to choose what they do with what happens to them. They get to decide what role an event will play in their life. They have the power to write the end of their own story. Highlight(yellow) - October 22: How You See It Matters &gt; Page 330 · Location 4072 Will your children be affected by things that happen? By having to change teachers midyear because of a move? By having glasses? By a divorce? By their learning issues? Yes. It would be dishonest to claim otherwise. But negatively affected? That’s up to you. Because how you decide to see it and, more important, how you choose to respond are going to determine how your children perceive these events as well. Highlight(yellow) - October 26: Don’t Deprive Them of This &gt; Page 334 · Location 4117 Some kids are extroverts. Some are introverts. But every kid needs to know how to be alone and to be happy in that space. There are lots of opportunities for you to help them develop this ability, depending on their age and personality, of course. When they start stirring in the morning, don’t rush in. When they’re quietly playing in their room, take a step back. Let them be bored. Highlight(yellow) - October 27: Let Them Know About Your Battles &gt; Page 335 · Location 4133 There has never been a parent (or a human being) who didn’t have their own battles. If we don’t explain this to our children, if we can’t be vulnerable or honest with them, there will forever be an unbridgeable gap between us.
