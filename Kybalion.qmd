# The Kybalion by The Three Initiates

The Kybalion is a book on the teachings of the Hermetic philosophy, which is a set of spiritual principles that are said to be based on the writings of the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus. The Kybalion was published in 1908 and attributed to three initiates, who are referred to as "the masters" in the book. The identity of the three initiates is unknown and there is some debate about whether they were real individuals or simply pseudonyms used by the book's author or authors. The Kybalion is a key text in the study of Hermeticism and has been influential in the development of various spiritual and metaphysical movements. It covers a range of topics, including the principles of mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, and causation. *Source: chatgpt.*

## The Seven Principles

1.  "*The all is Mind; The Universe is Mental.*"

4.  "*Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.*"

5.  "*Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.*"

6.  "*Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.*"

7.  "*Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.*"

## The All and Higher Energy

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and characteristics, even down "to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, desire for offerings and worship, and all the other survivals from the days of the childhood of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown men and women, and are rapidly being discarded.*"

2.  "*Spirit is simply a name that men give to the highest conception of Infinite Living Mind---it means"the Real Essence"---it means Living Mind, as much superior to Life and Mind as we know them, as the latter are superior to mechanical Energy and Matter.*"

## On Mental States

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*A knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those of other people. He will see that these states are all matters of degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration at will---to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate methods change the polarity when the same is desirable.*"

2.  "*The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student, polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to"refusing" to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a "denial" of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized.*"

3.  "*But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man's mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and enjoys but little---he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense suffering.*"

## On Free Will

::: {style="color: gray"}
1.  "*We do not wish to enter into a consideration of Free Will, or Determinism, in this work, for various reasons. Among the many reasons, is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a man may be both Free and yet bound by Necessity, depending upon the meaning of the terms, and the height of Truth from which the matter is examined. The ancient writers express the matter thus:"The further the creation is from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches, the nearer Free is it.*"

2.  "*The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity, environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying,"Why, I certainly am free to act and do as I please---I do just what I want to do," but they fail to explain whence arise the "want to" and "as I please." What makes them "want to" do one thing in preference to another; what makes them "please" to do this, and not do that? Is there no "because" to their "pleasing" and "Wanting"? The Master can change these "pleases" and "wants" into others at the opposite end of the mental pole. He is able to "Will to will," instead of to will because some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a tendency or desire within him so to do.*"
