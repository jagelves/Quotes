# The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist's Guide to Success in Business and Life

Avinash Dixit is a highly respected economist and professor, known for his influential contributions across various subfields of economics, including microeconomics, game theory, international trade, public economics, and industrial organization. Born in 1944 in Mumbai, India, Dixit earned degrees in mathematics and economics from St. Xavier’s College, the University of Cambridge, and MIT. He held the position of John J. F. Sherrerd '52 University Professor of Economics, Emeritus, at Princeton University.

Dixit’s work spans theoretical and applied economics, with notable contributions like the Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition, which has been pivotal in understanding product differentiation and competition. His book Investment Under Uncertainty (co-authored with Robert Pindyck) is also widely regarded as a foundational text in economics, using options theory to model investment decisions under uncertainty.

He has held leadership positions in prestigious economic associations, such as the Econometric Society and the American Economic Association, and has authored several widely respected books on economics and strategy. *Source: chatgpt.*

1.  "*Imagine what would happen if there were some known formula that determined who would be audited by the IRS. Before you submitted a tax return, you could apply the formula to see if you would be audited. If an audit was predicted, but you could see a way to “amend” your return until the formula no longer predicted an audit, you probably would do so. If an audit was unavoidable, you would choose to tell the truth. The result of the IRS being completely predictable is that it would audit exactly the wrong people. All those audited would have anticipated their fate and chosen to act honestly, while those spared an audit would have only their consciences to watch over them. When the IRS audit formula is somewhat fuzzy, everyone stands some risk of an audit; this gives an added incentive for honesty.*"

9.  "*Tit for tat is as clear and simple as you can get; the opponent does not have to do much thinking or calculation about what you are up to. It is nice in that it never initiates cheating. It is provocable—that is, it never lets cheating go unpunished. And it is forgiving, because it does not hold a grudge for too long and is willing to restore cooperation.*"

10. "*People realize they can’t change what the other side has done once they’ve been told what the other side has done. But if it remains open or undisclosed, then they imagine that their actions might have some influence—or that the other side will somehow be employing the same reasoning chain and reach the same outcome they do. Since Cooperate, Cooperate is preferred to Defect, Defect, the person chooses Cooperate.*"

11. "*The game we have here is a cousin to the prisoners’ dilemma, a life and death case of the “stag hunt” game analyzed by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In the stag hunt, if everyone works together to capture the stag, they succeed and all eat well. A problem arises if some hunters come across a hare along the way. If too many hunters are sidetracked chasing after hares, there won’t be enough hunters left to capture the stag. In that case, everyone will do better chasing after rabbits. The best strategy is to go after the stag if and only if you can be confident that most everyone is doing the same thing. You have no reason not to chase after the stag, except if you lack confidence in what others will do.*"

12. "*But what, precisely, constitutes “prominence”? One strategy, say Stag, may be prominent in Fred’s mind, but that is not enough for him to make that choice. He must ask himself whether the same strategy is also prominent for Barney. And that in turn involves asking whether Barney will think it prominent to Fred.*"

17. "*Suppose you are the kicker in the soccer example, and the goalie is using his best mix: Left 41.7 percent and Right 58.3 percent of the time. Then you will score a goal 79.6 percent of the time whether you kick to the Left, the Right, or any mixture of the two. Observing this, you might be tempted to spare yourself the calculation of your own best mix, just stick to any one action, and rely on the other player using his best mix. The problem is that unless you use your best mix, the other does not have the incentive to go on using his. If you stick to the Left, for example, the goalie will switch to covering the Left also. The reason why you should use your best mix is to keep the other player using his.*"

21. "*Threats and promises, on the other hand, are more complex conditional moves; they require you to fix in advance a response rule, stating how you would respond to the other player’s move in the actual game.*"

24. "*When a company wants to promise rewards to its workers for improved productivity, a bonus that increases gradually with an increase in output or profit may be better than offering nothing if the performance does not exceed a set target, and a very large sum if it does.*"
:::

::: {style="color: gray"}
25. "*Very often you don’t know the exact size of a threat that is needed to deter or compel your adversary. You want to keep the size as low as possible to minimize the cost to you in the event that things go wrong and you have to go through with the action. So you start small and gradually raise the size of the threat. This is the delicate strategy of brinkmanship.*"
:::

::: {style="color: gray"}
26. "*But you may not know in advance the smallest effective size of a threat. That is why it makes sense to start small, and increase it gradually to find out when it works. As the size of the threatened action grows, the cost of carrying it out grows too.*"

28. "*The strategy of burning bridges (or boats) was used by several others. William the Conqueror’s army, invading England in 1066, burned its own ships, thus making an unconditional commitment to fight rather than retreat. Hernán Cortés followed the same strategy in his conquest of Mexico, giving orders upon arrival that all but one of his ships be burned or disabled. Although his soldiers were vastly outnumbered, they had no choice but to fight and win. “Had \[Cortés\] failed, it might well seem an act of madness…. Yet it was the fruit of deliberate calculation. There was no alternative in his mind but to succeed or perish.”*"

32. "*If you want to elicit information from someone else, you should set up a situation where that person would find it optimal to take one action if the information was of one kind, and another action if it was of another kind; action (or inaction) then reveals the information. This strategy is called screening.*"

33. "*Actions that are intended to convey a player’s private information to other players are called signals. For a signal to be a credible carrier of a specific item of information, it must be the case that the action is optimal for the player to take if, but only if, he has that specific information.*"

34. "*Consider who will find the transfer of balance option attractive. Since the maxpayer isn’t borrowing money on the card, there is no reason to switch over to Capital One. The deadbeat is not planning to pay the money back, so here, too, there is little interest in switching. Capital One’s offer is most attractive to the customers who have large amounts outstanding and are planning to pay the loan back.*"

36. "*This situation, where all types (or all people possessing different types of information) take the same action, and therefore the action is completely uninformative, is called a pooling equilibrium of the signaling game—the different types end up in the same pool of signals. By contrast, the kind of equilibrium where one type signals and the other does not, so that the action accurately identifies or separates the types, is a separating equilibrium.*"

37. "*To overcome this problem, the trick that sellers commonly use is to create different versions of the same good and price the versions differently. Each customer is free to select any version and pay the price set by the seller for that version, so there is no overt discrimination. But the seller sets the attributes and prices of each version so that different types of customers will choose different versions. These actions implicitly reveal the customers’ private information, namely their willingness to pay. The sellers are screening the buyers.*"

"*PITS has to keep the first-class fare sufficiently low to give the business travelers enough incentive to choose this service and not “defect” to making the choice that PITS intends for the tourists. Such a requirement, or constraint, on the screener’s strategy is called an incentive compatibility constraint.*"
:::

::: {style="color: gray"}
39. "*But at \$140 the economy-class fare is already at the limit of the tourists’ willingness to pay. If PITS raised it to even \$141, it would lose these customers altogether.

40. "*The important insight from game theory is to recognize early on the potential for future lock-in—once one option has enough of a head start, superior technological alternatives may never get the chance to develop. Thus there is a potentially great payoff in the early stages from spending more time figuring out not only what technology meets today’s constraints but also what options will be the best for the future.*"

43. "*Values come in two flavors, private and common. In a world of private values, your value for the item doesn’t depend at all on what others think it is worth. Thus your value of a personalized signed copy of The Art of Strategy doesn’t depend on what your neighbor might think it is worth. In a common value situation, the bidders understand that the item has the same value for all of them, although each might have a different view as to what that common value is.*"

44. "*A Japanese auction, all of the bidders start with their hands raised or buttons pressed. The bidding goes up via a clock. The clock might start at 30 and then proceed to 31, 32,… and upwards. So long as your hand is raised, you are in the bidding. You drop out by lowering your hand. The catch is that once you lower your hand, you can’t put it back up again. The auction ends when only one bidder remains.*"

45. "*In a Vickrey auction, all the bids are placed in a sealed envelope. When the envelopes are opened to determine the winner, the highest bid wins. But there’s a twist. The winner doesn’t pay his or her bid. Instead, the winner only has to pay the second highest bid.*"
