<p>Epictetus was a Greek philosopher who lived in the first and second centuries AD. He was born a slave, but eventually gained his freedom and became a respected teacher. Epictetus is known for his philosophy of Stoicism, which emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with reason and virtue. He believed that individuals have control over their own thoughts and actions, and that they should strive to cultivate inner peace and happiness. Epictetus’s teachings have had a significant influence on Western philosophy and have been widely studied and admired for centuries. <em>Source: chatgpt.</em><br>

Don’t you find it difficult to wash? Don’t you get soaked when it rains? Aren’t you exposed to no end of uproar and shouting and other irritations? But by balancing all of these things off against the remarkable nature of spectacle, I imagine that you’re able to accept and endure them. Come now, haven’t you been endowed with faculties that enable you to bear whatever may come about? Haven’t you been endowed with greatness of soul? And with courage? And with endurance? If only I have greatness of soul, what reason is left for me to be worried about anything that may come to pass? What can disconcert or trouble me, or seem in any way distressing? Shall I fail to apply my capacities to the end for which I have received them, but instead groan and lament about things that come about?</em>”</li>

<li>“<em>From this day forth, then, whenever we fail to act rightly we’ll ascribe the blame to nothing other than the judgment that led us to act as we did, and will endeavor to destroy it and cut it out, even more than with tumors and abscesses of our body. In like fashion we will also ascribe what we do right to the same cause. No longer will we blame slave, or neighbor, or wife, or children as being responsible for any of our ills, since we’re now convinced that unless we judge things to be of a certain nature, we don’t carry out the actions that follow from that judgment. Now when it comes to forming a judgment, or not forming one, we’re the masters of that, and not things outside ourselves.</em>”</li>

Things that the faculty in your possession is well fitted to deal with present themselves to you, and yet you renounce the use of it at the very moment when you should be keeping it open for use and fully attentive. Shouldn’t you be giving thanks, rather, to the gods for having enable you to rise above everything that they have placed within your power, and having rendered you accountable only for what is subject to your control? With regard to your parents, they have discharged you from all accountability; and likewise with regard to your brothers and sisters, and to your body, and to your property, and life and death. Well then, what have they made you accountable for? Only for what lies within your power, the right use of your impressions.

Should someone like this be put to death? If you put the question in that way you’ll recognize the inhumanity of the thought that you’re expressing and see that it is equivalent to saying, should this blind man then or that deaf one be put to death? For the greatest harm that a person can suffer is the loss of the most valuable goods, and the most valuable thing that anyone can possess is correct choice.

If well, that person is beyond reproach. If badly, he himself pays the penalty, since it is impossible that one person should go astray and another one pay the penalty for it.

<li>“<em>For the same reason it is also ridiculous to say ‘give me some advice.’ What advice should I give you? No this is what you should say: ‘Ensure that my mind will be able to adapt itself to whatever comes about.’ For the former request amounts to the same as an illiterate person asking, ‘tell me what to write when some name is set for me to write.’ Suppose I tell him to write ‘Dion’, and teacher comes along and sets him not to that name, but ‘Theon’, what will come of it? What is he to write? But if you studied how to write, you’ll be ready for everything that may be dictated to you; and if not, what advice should I give you now? If the circumstances should dictate something different, what will you say, what will you do? Keep this general principle in mind, then, and you will never be in need of advice. But if you’re constantly hankering after external things, you’re sure to be tested this way and that in accordance with your master’s will. And who is your master?

Now if you consider yourself in isolation, it is natural for you to live to an advanced age, to be rich, and to enjoy good health; but if you consider yourself as a human being and as a part of some whole, it may be in the interest of the whole that you should now fall ill, now embark on a voyage and be exposed to danger, now suffer poverty, and perhaps even die before your time. Why do you resent this, then? Don’t you know that in isolation of foot is no longer a foot, and that you likewise will no longer be a human being? What, then, is a human being? A part of a city, first of all that which is that which is made up of gods and human beings, then that which is closest to us and which we call a city, which is a microcosm of the universal city.</em>”</li>

<li>“<em>‘What then if someone injuries me won’t I injure him in return?’ Consider first what injury is, and recall what you’ve heard from the philosophers. If it is the case, then that the good lies in choice, and the bad likewise, see whether what you’ve just said amounts to this: ‘since the person in question has injured himself by inflicting some wrong on me, shouldn’t I injure myself by inflicting some wrong on him?’ Why don’t we picture the matter in some such way as that, instead of counting it as an injury when we suffer some loss with regard to our body or possessions, while counting it as no injury at all where our choice is affected? It is that when one is deceived or commits an injustice, one suffers no pain in one’s head, or eyes, or one’s hip, nor does one lose any land; and we’re concerned about nothing other than things of that kind. As to whether our choice is kept honest and trustworthy, or will On the contrary be shameful and unreliable unreliable, that doesn’t cause us the slightest concern, except when it comes to making fine speeches in the classroom. And so the progress that we make extends only to speechifying, and apart from that we advance no not a step further.</em>”</li>
