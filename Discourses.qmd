## On Complaining

1. "*But unpleasant and distressing things come about in this life. And don't such things come about at Olympia? Aren't you scorched by the heat? Aren't you crowded and jostled? Don't you find it difficult to wash? Don't you get soaked when it rains? Aren't you exposed to no end of uproar and shouting and other irritations? But by balancing all of these things off against the remarkable nature of spectacle, I imagine that you're able to accept and endure them. Come now, haven't you been endowed with faculties that enable you to bear whatever may come about? Haven't you been endowed with greatness of soul? And with courage? And with endurance? If only I have greatness of soul, what reason is left for me to be worried about anything that may come to pass? What can disconcert or trouble me, or seem in any way distressing? Shall I fail to apply my capacities to the end for which I have received them, but instead groan and lament about things that come about?*"
