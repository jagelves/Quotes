# Zen Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki

Shunryu Suzuki (1904–1971) was a Japanese Zen monk and teacher who is widely credited with popularizing Zen Buddhism in the United States. He is best known for founding the San Francisco Zen Center and for his influential book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, which became a classic of Zen literature.

Suzuki was born in Japan and ordained as a Zen monk at an early age. In 1959, he moved to San Francisco, where he began teaching Zen meditation to a growing number of American students. He emphasized the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) as central to Zen practice and encouraged students to approach life with a "beginner's mind," which means an open and humble attitude toward learning and experience.

Suzuki's teachings bridged the gap between traditional Zen and modern life, making Zen practice accessible to Western audiences. His legacy continues through the institutions he helped establish, including the San Francisco Zen Center and the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the first Zen monastery in the Western world. *Source: chatgpt.*

You and I are just swinging doors.*"
