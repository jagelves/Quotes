# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is a collection of quotes that have been instrumental in my own journey to develop a deeper understanding of the world and improve my mental models. They have provided inspiration, guidance, and new perspectives that have helped me make more informed decisions and better navigate the complexities of life. I have organized the quotes into themes to make it easier to find the ones that resonate with you. As I continue to learn and grow, I will be adding more quotes to this collection, so be sure to check back for updates.
