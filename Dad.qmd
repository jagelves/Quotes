Our kids shouldn’t just be expected to deal with it. They should be communicated to and informed with respect.

Highlight(yellow) - April 23: Don’t Thrust Them Away > Page 127 · Location 1631

Your job isn’t just to protect your kids from other people. It’s to protect them from your own bad habits, your own temper, your own flaws too.

Highlight(yellow) - April 27: You’re the Voice in Their Heads > Page 131 · Location 1694
Speak to them the way you’d want them to speak to themselves. Because it’s not a matter of if they will internalize the things they heard growing up; it’s a matter of what they will internalize. Put a good voice in their head so they might remember the good stuff.

Highlight(yellow) - May 20: Don’t Just Assume It Will Work Out > Page 158 · Location 1999

Highlight(yellow) - May 25: Are You Teaching Them Values? > Page 163 · Location 2067
The purpose of education is not to make your kids more selfish, more greedy, more convinced of their own ideas or superiority. No, it’s to make them better citizens, better human beings, and hopefully, someday, better parents themselves.

You still have so much time in front of you. So much ability, so much potential to fulfill. You decide the rest of the story. It’s up to you.

Your story is the compass and the map on the journey that will lead them to realism, optimism, skepticism, cynicism, or fatalism.
Highlight(yellow) - June 26: You Have to Face Your Flaws > Page 198 · Location 2517
If you want to be a great parent, you’re going to have to deal with your crap. You can’t carry baggage—it’s too dangerous with a kid around. You risk dropping it on them. There can be no more hiding, no more deferring. The bill is due and you have to pay it: in therapy, in conversations with your spouse, in the pages of your journal. You have to face your flaws. Because there are little people who did not choose to be stuck in the same house with you and should not have to be trapped with a monster or a brick wall for a parent.

Highlight(yellow) - July 4: Don’t Tie Down Your Eagle > Page 210 · Location 2625
You can’t hold your children back. You can’t resent that they’re different. You can’t hold them back with antiquated notions about gender or class. Their choices say nothing about your choices.

Highlight(yellow) - July 6: You Have to Do This. We Need It. > Page 212 · Location 2649

Highlight(yellow) - July 10: Work with Them to Find Their Lane > Page 216 · Location 2705
Our job as parents is to put our kids in environments in which they can thrive and blossom. Our job is to work with them to find their lane.

Highlight(yellow) - July 11: Let Them Decide > Page 217 · Location 2723
When your kids feel a pull toward something creative or fulfilling, the worst thing you can do as a parent is prevent them from going in that direction.
Highlight(yellow) - July 12: Don’t Judge Them Too Harshly . . . or Quickly > Page 218 · Location 2738
We are not nearly as good at evaluating ability and predicting the future as we think we are. So we have to be forgiving. We can’t jump to conclusions. We have to give kids the benefit of the doubt. We have to root for them, not write them off.
Highlight(yellow) - July 13: Teach Them to Choose > Page 219 · Location 2752
Teach them how to choose. Empower them. Make sure they know how to decide, and to be okay with their decision even if they decide wrong. It doesn’t matter that you know more. What matters is that you let them learn.
Highlight(yellow) - July 24: You Have to Listen > Page 230 · Location 2905
That little fellow is always trying to tell you things. Of course, it’s not always explicit. Sometimes “I want to learn to be useful” comes out as “I want to learn to vacuum.” Sometimes “I want to be a good friend” comes out as “Can you drive me to Bobby’s house?” Sometimes “I want to be a writer” comes out as an awkward kid who doesn’t want to watch sports with you.
Highlight(yellow) - July 26: What Are You Making Them Do? > Page 232 · Location 2927
We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore, excellence is not an act but a habit.
Highlight(yellow) - July 29: Do Not Get in the Way of Their Primal Inclinations > Page 235 · Location 2972
Don’t force your interests on your child. Pay attention to their natural, primal inclinations, then foster their blossoming.

Highlight(yellow) - August 23: They Don’t Need a Lecture. They Need This. > Page 263 · Location 3300
What you really wanted—what you needed—was for someone to see why you were doing these things. You needed someone to guide you back to the right path and to help you realize the consequences of being off it.
Struggle and Emerge: (How to Raise Their Resilience)
Highlight(yellow) - October 12: Teach Them That They Decide the End of Every Story > Page 320 · Location 3942
Teach them to see hardship as fuel. Teach them to see an opportunity where others see an obstacle.

They get to decide what role an event will play in their life. They have the power to write the end of their own story.
Highlight(yellow) - October 22: How You See It Matters > Page 330 · Location 4072
Will your children be affected by things that happen? By having to change teachers midyear because of a move? By having glasses? By a divorce? By their learning issues? Yes. It would be dishonest to claim otherwise. But negatively affected? That’s up to you. Because how you decide to see it and, more important, how you choose to respond are going to determine how your children perceive these events as well.
Highlight(yellow) - October 26: Don’t Deprive Them of This > Page 334 · Location 4117
Some kids are extroverts. Some are introverts. But every kid needs to know how to be alone and to be happy in that space. There are lots of opportunities for you to help them develop this ability, depending on their age and personality, of course. When they start stirring in the morning, don’t rush in. When they’re quietly playing in their room, take a step back. Let them be bored.
Highlight(yellow) - October 27: Let Them Know About Your Battles > Page 335 · Location 4133
There has never been a parent (or a human being) who didn’t have their own battles. If we don’t explain this to our children, if we can’t be vulnerable or honest with them, there will forever be an unbridgeable gap between us.
Time Flies: (You Could Leave Life Right Now)
Highlight(yellow) - December 14: Is It Really Time to Go? > Page 390 · Location 4772
Encourage your kids. Resist the urge to hurry. It’s not really time to go. You’re exactly where you—and they—need to be.
